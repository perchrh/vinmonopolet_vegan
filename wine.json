It was just a few weeks ago that I got accosted at the farmers market by a few folks who couldn't believe that we would even consider making a wine that wasn't vegan.  It was very disheartening since we are trying very hard to move as many of our products towards sustainable and organic farming practices as possible.  We've even got to the point where all but one of the wines we completely make ourselves are from organic grapes.  So, your note was quite refreshing.  I am in the process of going back and looking through all our winemaking notes.  I'm not sure how familiar you are with our wines, but we have four labels:  Stumbling Block, Shy Chenin, Reversal, and Basket Case.  The Basket Case brand is a combination of wine that we produce ourselves as well as wine we have contract made for us by other wineries.  Though we are pretty involved in that wine making as well, I'm not comfortable telling you that they are Vegan-chances are they are not.  <b> As for the other three labels-Shy Chenin, Stumbling Block, and Reversal, we make all those wines and I am 90% sure they are Vegan.  I am only hesitating until I get all of the records for all of the lots in front of me at one time.  As a general rule, we try very hard not to add animal products, not because we are necessarily against it (although there is so much interest we are planning on making our wines 'Vegan' just because we can) but because our style of winemaking is to be as minimal as possible.  To my knowledge we have not done any fining with animal products, but let me get back to you on that. Just out of curiosity, what do you as a vegan think of PVPP?

After checking with our winemaking team, I have learned that on a very limited number of our red wines we might add casein (from milk) and albumen (egg whites). Both of these are proteins and are used as fining agents to remove tannins and reduce astringency. These are removed as precipitates and it is doubtful any traces of these proteins remain after the fining operation. It depends from year to year which red wines may be put through this process, so I can't tell you specifically which wines might be affected. On the other hand, our white and blush wines, such as Chardonnay and White Zinfandel are not fined at all. They may go through a filtering agent such as cellulose pads or diatomaceous earth. In membrane filtration the wine is passed through a thin film of plastic polymer material having uniformly sized holes. In both cases nothing is added to the wine.\r\n\r\nAh, sounds semi-good, but then we get company email 2:\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting Beringer.  We do not recommend any of our wine for vegans due to the possibility that the wine has been clarified with fining agents such as egg albumin, casein, gelatin and isinglass. The winemakers decide on which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year). It is important to note that despite fining agents being used during the winemaking process, they are removed prior to bottling.

Prior to bottling, all flocculated protein residues are filtered off. In other words, while animal proteins may be employed, the final wine is effectively protein free.

This process was discovered ages ago to be an effective way to improve the flavor of red wines by limiting the astringency caused by the tannins. The egg whites settle to the bottom and are then filtered out. No residue of the egg whites remains in the wine.\r\n\r\nFor our white wines, we use a \"protein fining\"' or \"clarification\" process using Bentonite, a naturally occurring form of clay, to remove the \"haze\" of proteins present in the wine. Again, filtering leaves no residue remaining in the wine.\r\n\r\nBoth of these fining practices are standard in the wine industry globally.

Indeed, gelatine appears to be one of the clarifiers with greater agglutinating capabilities, and more selective power in the fining of wine. \r\nIn addition to that, gelatine is used in very low doses (average dose is 1 gr. per 100 liters of  must). We are talking about one gram of a transformed, purified, and sanitarily harmless product. On top of that, gelatine is eliminated from the wine by filtration, after agglutinating with the existing colloidal materials in the wine. \r\nAnother advantage of gelatine is that it offers high productivity during the filtration due to its agglutinating power. Otherwise, a couple of things could happen:\r\n\u2022\twine filtration cycles would be considerably shorter, increasing at the same time the filtration costs.\r\n\u2022\tit considerably would increase the volume of filtering earth needed with the inevitable environmental damages that this represents. \r\nFor the production of our Cava, we use both our own base wines and wines selected from other wineries. Some of these wineries have implemented modern methods to separate the lees (Mosto fining) based on modern flotation systems. One of the advantages of these systems is the elimination of filtering earths and, therefore, reducing the environmental impact. One of the key elements in this system is the use of the gelatine. \r\n<B>It is for these reasons that we sincerely believe that using small amounts of gelatine in the transformation process of wine, should not have any effect on consumption by vegetarians.\r\nIn conclusion, if we were not allowed to use gelatine, we would have to carry out a rigorous study on the consequences over our products and facilities. This would involve an important work of advising and control over our suppliers, which some of whom have adapted their systems to the separation of lees process described previously.</B>\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"Our wines are not suitable for vegans since we use a clarifying agent that has egg whites. \"\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"Our wines are not suitable for vegans since we use a clarifying agent that has egg whites.\"\r\n\r\n","editor":"","url":"http://www.freixenet.com/","tag":"Freixenet-Sparkling-Wines","id":575,"updated_on":"2010-01-02T06:43:03-05:00","doubled_by":"Cassie","fax":"","phone":"+34 938 917 000","checked_by":"Ingrid","status":"Not Vegan friendly","email":"freixenet@freixenet.es","state":"Barcelona","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"address":"2320 Marinship Way, Suite 140","city":"Sausalito","company_name":"French Rabbit","country":"USA","created_on":"2008-02-21T22:16:00-05:00","postal":"94965","notes":"Company email (December 2012):\r\n\"Our winemaking team simply wrote:\r\nAfter checking, nothing has changed in our production process- Still no animal products.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, French rabbit  remains vegan friendly.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"French rabbit wines (all varieties) are vegan-friendly.

We maintain a special section of our website that only lists our vegan wines: http://www.huntwines.com/Vegan-Wines.  On that page you will also find a link to a chart that details which wines are made with and without animal products.  If the wine does contain any animal products, it is listed specifically on that chart.  Only one wine is made outside our facility, our Chardonnay Champagne, and we are unsure if any animal products are used in its production and consequently do not list it as a vegan-friendly wine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm writing to let you know that the wines at Hunt Country Vineyards, located in Upstate NY, are vegan (with only a couple exceptions, I'm still working on those ones).

However, the 2003, 2008, 2009 and 2010 vintages do not have any animal ingredients. Unfortunately all of our Chardonnay is fined at the juice stage with casein, a milk bi-product.  \r\nOur product is only manufactured at our winery in Healdsburg, CA.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Thank-you for emailing your question regarding the use of fining agents on our wine.  I don't know if you are referring to our Chardonnay or our Cabernet so I will attempt to answer both.\r\n\r\nChardonnay:  we use a combination of bentonite (earth based ) which is a montmorillonite clay that is used to drop out any protein that may cause a haze in our white wine.  For the juice, prior to fermentation, a combination of both bentonite and casein (a milk derived protein) is used which softens the astringent nature of our wine by minimizing the effect of the skins from the grape pressing.  The sediment (lees) from the deposition of the fining agent and the proteins, phenolics from the juice are racked (drawn) off and sent out for disposal (actually another winery uses the settlings). Of course our Chardonnay is filtered prior to bottling.\r\n\r\nCabernet:  the only fining agents we use are protein/animal based: gelatin and egg white.  The gelatin is used in very small quantities and helps remove amorphous material as well as microbial (yeasts and malolactic bacteria) that cloud the wine.  Fresh egg whites (not the yolk) is added as a way of balancing out the oak tannins and the fruit derived tannins.  It is a very common procedure used throughout the world; but some winemakers elect not to use egg whites as they fear it will remove flavor components.  We use egg whites because we feel the flavor components are enhanced.  I don't know if it is possible for residual egg whites to be present in our wine.  We filter our wine prior to bottling and after fining (0.65 microns absolute- which means nothing passes through the filter larger than 0.65 microns.  This is to eliminate any residual yeast and most malolactic bacteria) so I would imagine that the bound egg white with the tannin complex is removed.\"","editor":"sarah","url":"http://jordanwinery.com/","tag":"Jordan-Winery","id":541,"updated_on":"2012-11-16T19:46:07-05:00","doubled_by":"Elizabeth","fax":"","phone":"800-654-1213","checked_by":"Megan","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","email":"info@jordanwinery.com","state":"CA","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"address":"Larson Family Vineyards, 23355 Millirick Road","city":"Sonoma","company_name":"Joseph Carr Wines","country":"USA","created_on":"2012-01-12T20:40:41-05:00","postal":"95476","notes":"Company email (January 2012):\r\n\"No animal products what so ever and not sub contracted.\r\nMy daughter is vegan.\"\r\n\r\n","editor":"sarah","url":"www.josephcarrwine.com","tag":"Joseph-Carr-Wines","id":2056,"updated_on":"2012-01-12T20:41:13-05:00","doubled_by":"","fax":"","phone":"518 364 5201","checked_by":"Kevin","status":"Vegan Friendly","email":"jcarr@josephcarrwine.com","state":"CA","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"address":"200 Taplin Road","city":"Saint Helena","company_name":"Joseph Phelps Vineyards","country":"USA","created_on":"2012-05-14T16:24:33-04:00","postal":"94574","notes":"Company email (May 2012):\r\n\"1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2001 through 2008 are all vegan.\"\r\n","editor":"sarah","url":"www.jpvwines.com","tag":"Joseph-Phelps-Vineyards","id":2258,"updated_on":"2012-05-14T16:27:36-04:00","doubled_by":"","fax":"","phone":"800.707.5789","checked_by":"Erin","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","email":"jpvwines@jpvwines.com","state":"CA","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"address":"1811 Niagara Stone Road (Hwy 55) RR 2","city":"Niagara-on-the-Lake","company_name":"Joseph's Estate Wines Inc.","country":"Canada","created_on":"2007-10-26T11:43:00-04:00","postal":"L0S 1J0","notes":"Company email:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, our wines are vegan-friendly.

Well, we had to add some sugar in 2007.\r\n\r\nBackground on animals and wine: basically, animal products are added because the winemaker is trying to use protein to make other chemicals such as tannins fall out of solution.  This is almost exclusive to red wines.  When we fine white wines, we are trying to remove protein, so we are adding things such as bentonite clay.\r\n\r\nThe hotter the climate the grapes are grown, the more pressure there is to use fining agents on red wine.  Hot climates increase the skin to weight ratio at harvest, meaning the grapes have more tannin in them.\r\n\r\nWe don't fine our red wines: meaning no ox blood, isinglass, milk protein, egg whites, etc.  We have found that patience and time in the barrel address the needs.  We sometimes add Stabavin to our white wines, which is Gum Arabic.

We process all of our wines here at the winery in Healdsburg, CA.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"The use of fining agents in winemaking to make wine taste/smell/look better is an ages old practice. Fining can eliminate bitterness, astringency, brown color, cloudiness, and other things best left out of wine. After the fining agent is added to wine, it clings physically or electrostatically to whatever protein or other targeted substance in the wine, and gravity generally brings it to the bottom of the storage vessel. The wine can then be drawn off the sediment, and may or may not be subjected to filtration. Some fining agents are \"earth\" based, and some are \"animal\" based. While theoretically no fining agent will end up in the final wine, strict adherents to some versions of vegetarianism would prefer not to make use of any product if animal derived substances were used during processing.\r\nFining is never done formulaically. Rather, if a wine might be subject to some improvement in, let's say astringency, then a representative sample of the wine is trialed under laboratory conditions with a variety of fining agents in varying amounts that are known to reduce astringency. The four best fining agents to reduce astringency are all animal based: egg whites, gelatin, isinglass (from fish), and casein (from milk). Other commonly used fining agents include bentonite (a clay), Sparkolloid (from algae), and activated carbon. Keep in mind that fining is an optional tool, and if a wine is delicious as it is, it may not require fining at all.\r\nSo what's a vegan to do?\r\nGenerally, red wines are more likely (but not necessarily) to have been fined for astringency with an animal based product than white wines. Some red wines are bottled as \"unfined\" and these are really the only prudent choice for a strict vegan. White wines, too, are sometimes fined with casein or isinglass, so it is always recommended that vegans contact a winery directly to learn what wines are best suited to them.\r\nOf the current releases of Rodney Strong Vineyards wines, vegans should be comfortable enjoying our 2007 Charlotte's Home Sauvignon Blanc, and our 2007 Sonoma County Chardonnay, both of which were finished only with \"earth\" based fining.\"","editor":"jason","url":"http://www.rodneystrong.com","tag":"Rodney-Strong-Vineyards","id":769,"updated_on":"2011-11-14T20:25:30-05:00","doubled_by":"Annette, Sam","fax":"","phone":"866-779-4637","checked_by":"AngelA","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","email":"collectorscircle@rodneystrong.com","state":"CA","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"address":"2306 Hayman Road","city":"Kelowna","company_name":"Rollingdale Wines","country":"Canada","created_on":"2009-04-16T06:13:00-04:00","postal":"V1Z 1Z5","notes":"Company email (July 2012):\r\n\"Please find attached a list of our vegan wines.

Our premium free run reds are bottled unfined, unfiltered, making all of our top reds Vegan Friendly. However the press red, in our case (Tumbleweed Red) is fined with egg white to strip tannins.That is our only fined red.  Other fining agents strip the colour from red.\r\n\r\n-  White wines I usually just use bentonite, but again our premiums are generally free run, or very lightly pressed to avoid astringency, and the bentonite is sufficient to achieve protein stability when properly used.  The press white has more astringency from seeds, skins, and stems, and may require gelatin which is a very strong fining agent.  Improperly used it can easily strip a wine bare, and is rarely used in my cellar.  The single wine of ours that I have used gelatin on is the, as of yet unreleased, Tumbleweed White NV (accumlated years of press fractions).  On our 2006 Luminescence Chardonnay, we used some Isinglass in fining as a bit of an experiment, but I found that I much prefer to use bentonite for the compact lees and faster settling.  \r\n\r\nOur 2007 Luminescence is the only Certified Organic Chardonnay in BC at the moment, definitely Vegan Friendly!  The 2008 will also be...\r\nThat would make all of the other Chardonnay vintages Vegan Friendly, as well as our Riewurztrafeleron*, previously Riewurztrafelser Blanc.  *Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Ehrenfelser, Auxerrois, Chardonnay, Semillon!  100% of the whites from Stoney Slopes Vineyard in OK Falls in one tank!

You are correct in saying that many wineries use fining products in their wines but I think that it is much less than in the past.  I remember when I first started winemaking in the early 90\u2019s I used several of these products.  But now because of educational advances in grape growing and winemaking many of these products are unnecessary.  For example, in red wines these products were used to mellow out harsh tannins after the fermentation.  Because the vineyard canopies have been opened up to allow more sunlight onto the fruit these tannins are not as hard.  Also in the winery there is more attention to pump-over management and temperature of fermentation which reduces the extraction of these harsh tannins.  So, to answer your question here at St Francis we do not use any animal based products in our wines.\"\r\n\r\n...And later we got some clarification (no pun intended):\r\n\r\n\"Vegan friendly\"? Meaning do we like vegans? Of course!\r\n\r\nIf you are asking if our wines are vegan, I would say yes to all except the zinfandels, which SOMETIMES receive dosing of an egg-white product. The purpose is it eliminates certain killer yeast that can hinder fermentations. We've only used it on zins since they come in so ripe. That substance is immediately dropped to the bottom, and by the time the wine is bottled it has been through a couple rackings + sterile filtering so there would be no remnants whatsoever of the egg whites. But, to be truthful I would say no to the zins.\"","editor":"sarah","url":"http://www.stfranciswinery.com/","tag":"St-Francis-Winery","id":863,"updated_on":"2010-07-06T20:53:41-04:00","doubled_by":"Anne","fax":"","phone":"707-833-2148","checked_by":"Catherine","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","email":"HMunden@stfranciswinery.com","state":"CA","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"address":"47189 Bailey Road","city":"Chilliwack","company_name":"St Urban Winery Ltd","country":"Canada","created_on":"2009-04-16T06:23:00-04:00","postal":"V2R 4S8","notes":"Company Email:\r\nDo St Urban wines contain any animal ingredients (such as milk, eggs, honey, etc.), or are animal products used in the processing/filtration of the product (such as isinglass, gelatin, caesin, egg whites, blood, etc.)?\r\n\r\n\"No they don't.\"","editor":"","url":"http://www.sturbanwinery.com","tag":"St-Urban-Winery-Ltd","id":622,"updated_on":"2009-12-09T14:43:55-05:00","doubled_by":"","fax":"","phone":"604-824-6233","checked_by":"Nicole R","status":"Vegan Friendly","email":"sturban@shaw.ca","state":"BC","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"address":"5657 Zena Road NW","city":"Salem","company_name":"St. Innocent Winery","country":"USA","created_on":"2010-02-24T13:51:00-05:00","postal":"97304","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"None of our current releases contain any animal products.

It's an interesting one.   The short answer - no we don't use animal products in making our wine.  The gentle way we grow, pick, and ferment our grapes leads to naturally balanced tannin levels, so we don't need to add animal proteins to achieve correct tannin levels.\r\n\r\nNow for the long answer:\r\nIt's true that animal proteins are frequently used in winemaking. Their function is usually to control the levels of tannins in the wine.  Tannins are complex molecules that react with proteins.  They are naturally produced by many types of plants as a natural defensive compound against pests and stressful conditions.  In wine, overripe or stressed grapes can produce large quantities of tannins while still on the vine, and these tannin levels can be exacerbated by rough handling of the grapes during fermentation in the winery. \r\n\r\nWhen tannins react with the proteins in your mouth, they produce a drying, gritty sensation.  In subtle quantities, tannins create a velvety texture to the wine;  in greater quantities the sensation is decidedly unpleasant.  That's why some winemakers regularly fine their wines to remove excess tannins.  The tannins react with the proteins in the fining agent and precipitate them to the bottom of the barrel, making the wines taste softer and more palatable.\r\n\r\nHowever, at The Eyrie Vineyards we moderate tannins naturally.  We carefully manage the amount of sunlight that falls on the fruit, keeping stress to a minimum while boosting ripeness.  Our organic spray program keeps the grapes free of mildews and molds that lead the plants to create defensive tannins.  Our deep rooted vines tap into perennial sources of water.  As a result, drought stress is minimized and so are tannins.  \r\n\r\nThe grapes are picked by hand, destemmed whole berry, pressed in old fashioned platen style presses, and aged in neutral oak barrels.    These gentle winemaking techniques preserve the fruit flavors and give us naturally balanced wines that require little intervention on the part of the winemaker.\"\r\n\r\n","editor":"sarah","url":"http://www.eyrievineyards.com/","tag":"The-Eyrie-Vineyards-BlackCap","id":117,"updated_on":"2009-12-09T10:39:40-05:00","doubled_by":"","fax":"503.472.5124","phone":"888.440.4970","checked_by":"Brendon","status":"Vegan Friendly","email":"jason@eyrievineyards.com","state":"OR","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"address":"4556 Lincoln Avenue","city":"Beamsville","company_name":"The Good Earth Vineyard and Winery Inc.","country":"USA","created_on":"2012-05-25T10:16:27-04:00","postal":"L0R 1B3","notes":"Company email (May 2012):\r\n\"Of the wines that are currently available for sale in our retail space the following are vegan:\r\n1. 2009 Cabernet Franc\r\n2. 2009 Pinot Noir\r\n3. 2010 Late Harvest Cabernet Franc\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks we are releasing our 2010 Cabernet Franc, 2011 Betty's Blend, and 2011 Rose.

Thank you for asking and I hope that you continue to enjoy Smoking Loon and Pepperwood Grove wines as a part of your healthy vegan diet. \"","editor":"jason","url":"http://www.donandsons.com/threeloosescrews/","tag":"Three-Loose-Screws-Wine-Company","id":664,"updated_on":"2011-11-16T10:47:48-05:00","doubled_by":"AngelA","fax":"","phone":"707-933-1704","checked_by":"Ryan R","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","email":"gkitchens@donandsons.com","state":"CA","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"address":"P.O.

The answer, unfortunately, is not too clear. Our wine makers use various fining agents during the wine making process. Some of these products are suitable for vegans, however sometimes in order to get the wine just right, they add products such as gelatin, which I know is not something that is appropriate for vegans. The hard part is that it depends on how the wine making is going and how the particular \"recipe batch\" is going. The wine makers then decide which fining agents should be added to achieve the desired end result.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry we don't have a more specific answer but unfortunately, it does vary from vintage to vintage.

Your question brings up a very interesting issue.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, winemakers have used traditional, natural techniques to fine and filter their wines.  Some of these techniques involve animal byproducts including, for example, egg whites, which may be used and then removed in certain steps of the winemaking process.  This may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the centuries-old art of winemaking, however these practices are widely used to this day and often result in levels well below human detection - the scale of which is measured by single parts per million gallons or liters.\r\n\r\nWhile most would consider this level insignificant, we take the concerns of our vegan friends very seriously and in good conscience, do not claim our wines to be 100% vegan.

The only reference I can find in regards to animal products in wine production is the very old rustic Italian practise of including a pound of horseflesh in a barrel of wine, to 'make it stronger'. That sounds really disgusting, and horses are for petting, not eating.\r\n\r\nOur fining agents are derived from animals. Isinglass is a colloidal protein made from the swim bladders of Cichlid fish, dried, processed and dissolved\r\nin a liquid. As a side-note, the bladders are a by-product of a food fishery in Africa and the entire enterprise is completely sustainable.\r\n\r\nThe Chitosan is a long-chain sucrose polymer made from the shells of crustaceans like prawns, crabs, lobsters and shrimp. Again, it is a by-product of a food fishery.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is simple to replace these products with Agar gelatine, derived from seaweed and easily available from health food stores. Dosage rates are\r\nproblematic, but I would start with two teaspoons of gelatine powder dissolved in a cup of water to start.\r\n\r\nThese product facts aside, it's important to note that many non-animal derived foods and beverages have significant sources of animal-derived products in them, as a consequence of where they are grown and harvested. To quote California winemaker and researcher Lum Eisenman,\r\n\r\n\"On average, one ton of California wine grapes contains seven pounds of dirt, one mouse nest, 147 bees, 98 wasps, 1,014 earwigs, 1,833 ants, 10,899\r\nleafhoppers and three pounds of bird droppings. In addition, the waxy coating on grape skins contains many microorganisms. Grapes are crushed without washing, so crushed grapes contain several non-grape substances and many microorganisms. Consequently, attempting to sterilize crush equipment seems a bit futile. The nitrogen (bird droppings) and protein materials (bugs) are consumed during fermentation by the yeast. When fermentation is complete, the dirt, bees wings, earwig tails, etc. settle to the bottom of\r\nthe fermenters, and much of the yeast and ugly stuff is left behind when wine is racked.\"","editor":"sarah","url":"http://www.winexpert.com/","tag":"Winexpert-Home-Wine-Kit","id":1334,"updated_on":"2011-03-20T17:26:00-04:00","doubled_by":"","fax":"","phone":"1-800-339-2266","checked_by":"Shelley","status":"Not Vegan friendly","email":"tim.vandergrift@winexpert.com","state":"BC","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"address":"South Main Street","city":"Winterport","company_name":"Winterport Winery","country":"USA","created_on":"2010-05-27T08:07:00-04:00","postal":"04496","notes":"Company Email when asked Official Barnivore question:\r\n\"We do not add any of the things you mentioned to our wines and we determined that we have vegan-friendly wines and ales according to that criteria. \"","editor":"sarah","url":"http://winterportwinery.com/","tag":"Winterport-Winery","id":1080,"updated_on":"2010-05-27T08:07:00-04:00","doubled_by":"","fax":"","phone":"207-223-4500","checked_by":"Christina","status":"Vegan Friendly","email":"info@winterportwinery.com","state":"ME","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"address":"Kirchstr. 2, D-79227","city":"Schallstadt-Wolfenweiler","company_name":"Winzergenossenschaft Wolfenweiler","country":"Germany","created_on":"2013-01-12T12:22:27-05:00","postal":"","notes":"Company email (January 2013):\r\n\"unsere Weine werden alle mit Gelatine gekl\u00e4rt.
