While we do not make a practice of using animal products in our wines, we may, on occasion,\r\nresort to the use of egg whites (on a very small scale) to reduce excessive or harsh tannins.  We do our best to manage tannin pick up in the wines during fermentation but, every once in a while, a wine is\r\ntoo big, too tannic or too drying to fit the 14 Hands profile.  So, we will, from time to time, rely on the very effective, natural and traditional method of softening the wines by egg white fining.\r\n\r\nWe also do not manufacture our wines anywhere else in the world besides Washington state.\"",

(We can't be certified organic, due to the really tight regulations on the term itself, but we're moving closer and closer.)  \r\n\r\nHaving been a vegetarian for four years--as well as being married to one and having a boy who is nearly vegetarian--as well as having rescued five animals from shelters and given them lives in our home, I understand our relationship to animals better than most.  Emery was mostly correct in characterizing our use of gelatin, but the actual fact is that since the 2004 vintage, I can only remember one wine (275 G of Chardonnay) that was fined with gelatin.  (Gelatin is a unique fining agent used for one specific purpose, and there is no currently available substitute that can accomplish the same thing in the cellar.)  If we hadn't fined that wine, we would have had to pour out the equivalent of 1375 bottles of wine or approximately $15,000 worth of wine.)  And considering we have bottled around 100,000 gallons in that time, I think it's fair to say that we're pretty friendly to the vegan lifestyle.  Obviously, in that perspective, it would have been easy to say that we are 100% vegan-friendly, but I always try to be as honest with our customers as possible.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2012):\r\n\"Gelatin is the only animal substance we use, and it is only on extremely rare occasions. Yes, it is used as a fining agent.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2012):\r\n\"Our wine is about %99.99 vegan friendly. In the last 5 years of production, less than 1% of our wine had minute traces of animal ingredients. The ingredient was gelatin, and it typically settles to the bottom during fermentation, and is not detectable in the finished wine.\r\n\r\nWe may make a Mead Wine in the future, which would contain honey, but that would be the only instance honey would be introduced into a wine.\"",

The few that we sometimes use would be casein(milk protein), isinglass(dehydrated/powdered sturgeon air\r\nbladders), and egg whites. I can tell you that we have not used these products since 2008. Its always my goal as a winemaker to never use fining/clarification/\r\nfiltration/cold stabilization etc. on our wines, and\r\nonly in situations where its absolutely necessary would I even consider it. I hope this brief explanation helps. If you are interested in purchasing our wines the current 2009 ASV releases are animal product FREE!! And i can assure you i will continue to make them that way.

I am afraid that all our wines have been fined using animal based fining agents; often gelatin, egg or diary based fining agents and we can\u2019t recommend therefore that these wines would be suitable for vegans. There is continued research in this field to develop fining agents that are plant based and move away from the animal based winemaking products. These are still not yet as effective for producing well balanced approachable wines of good quality and so the preference in the industry remains for the animal based fining agents.\"",

It was just a few weeks ago that I got accosted at the farmers market by a few folks who couldn't believe that we would even consider making a wine that wasn't vegan.  It was very disheartening since we are trying very hard to move as many of our products towards sustainable and organic farming practices as possible.  We've even got to the point where all but one of the wines we completely make ourselves are from organic grapes.  So, your note was quite refreshing.  I am in the process of going back and looking through all our winemaking notes.  I'm not sure how familiar you are with our wines, but we have four labels:  Stumbling Block, Shy Chenin, Reversal, and Basket Case.  The Basket Case brand is a combination of wine that we produce ourselves as well as wine we have contract made for us by other wineries.  Though we are pretty involved in that wine making as well, I'm not comfortable telling you that they are Vegan-chances are they are not.  <b> As for the other three labels-Shy Chenin, Stumbling Block, and Reversal, we make all those wines and I am 90% sure they are Vegan.  I am only hesitating until I get all of the records for all of the lots in front of me at one time.  As a general rule, we try very hard not to add animal products, not because we are necessarily against it (although there is so much interest we are planning on making our wines 'Vegan' just because we can) but because our style of winemaking is to be as minimal as possible.  To my knowledge we have not done any fining with animal products, but let me get back to you on that. Just out of curiosity, what do you as a vegan think of PVPP?  It's basically a plastic that is used sort of like a fining agent.  I would think it would be considered Vegan, but I'm not that big a fan of sticking micro-petroleum particles into my wine.  Funny, huh?  Technically it would be Vegan, but certainly not organic!\"",

            "notes":"Company email: \r\nThank you for contacting us about our Beringer wines. After checking with our winemaking team, I have learned that on a very limited number of our red wines we might add casein (from milk) and albumen (egg whites). Both of these are proteins and are used as fining agents to remove tannins and reduce astringency. These are removed as precipitates and it is doubtful any traces of these proteins remain after the fining operation. It depends from year to year which red wines may be put through this process, so I can't tell you specifically which wines might be affected. On the other hand, our white and blush wines, such as Chardonnay and White Zinfandel are not fined at all. They may go through a filtering agent such as cellulose pads or diatomaceous earth. In membrane filtration the wine is passed through a thin film of plastic polymer material having uniformly sized holes. In both cases nothing is added to the wine.\r\n\r\nAh, sounds semi-good, but then we get company email 2:\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting Beringer.  We do not recommend any of our wine for vegans due to the possibility that the wine has been clarified with fining agents such as egg albumin, casein, gelatin and isinglass. The winemakers decide on which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year). It is important to note that despite fining agents being used during the winemaking process, they are removed prior to bottling.  We appreciate your interest in our wines!\r\n\r\nEmail 3 (April 09)\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"Thank you for contacting us about our Beringer Stone Cellars wines.

You should take them off your wine list and even consider running a blurb - Native Foods, Herbivore, and a ton of other vegan restaurants sell or have sold them, and tons of vegans I know like to drink it. Their white wines are vegan, but their red wines are NOT. I just got off the phone with James Caudill, one of their reps, and he confirmed it.\"\r\n\r\nSeconded by Mo - company email:\r\n\"We use egg whites in the fining process of our red wines. However, our white wines are free of any animal products and are vegetarian and vegan friendly.  Ages ago, it was discovered that egg whites added to wine would aid in removing unwanted tannins. This 'tannin fining' process is used to improve the flavor of red wines by limiting the astringency caused by the tannins. The egg whites settle to the bottom and are then filtered out. All residue of the egg whites is removed from the wine.\"",

As our winemakers make decisions about everything from harvesting the grapes to which corks to use in bottling, there are occasionally times when they feel that a wine needs some additional fining to remove excess color, solids, etc.  At that point, they might use something like egg whites or gelatin to improve the quality of the blend.  As a consumer, there is really no way for you to tell which blends we might have used these products in.

We strive to grow the grapes and make our wines using techniques to produce a well balanced wine.  Fining with animal products is not a standard practice in our winemaking.  We did however use egg whites in 2005 to improve the balance of our Merlot and Zinfandel.  We have not used any agents derived from animals since then.  This may be the reason that some websites show our wines as not vegan.  Cakebread Cellars\u2019 wines from vintages prior to 2005 and after 2005 have all been vegan.\r\n\r\nCompany Email (December 2010):\r\n\"There are eggs whites used in certain batches if it is not balanced. We don't really have a way of knowing which bottle would have it or not so we label it as may contain Egg whites.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email (June 2010):\r\n\"Our wines do not contain any form of gelatin however we do once an a while use egg whites.  Occasionally, we do fine our red wines with a protein fining agent to selectively remove polyphenols that are responsible for astringency.  It is not a common practice for us, but if necessary, we do use protein fining agents such as fresh egg whites in red wines. We listed the notice on the label to inform the consumer in case they were allergic to egg products.\"\r\n\r\n",

Some of these techniques involve animal byproducts including, for example, egg whites, which may be used and then removed in certain steps of the winemaking process.  This may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the centuries-old art of winemaking, however these practices are widely used to this day and often result in levels well below human detection - the scale of which is measured by single parts per million gallons or liters.\r\n\r\nWhile most would consider this level insignificant, we take the concerns of our vegan friends very seriously and in good conscience, do not claim our wines to be 100% vegan.  Although there are other wineries that may not make the same decision, we feel that honesty and integrity are the best winemaking techniques and hope our supporters enjoy the results!\"",

However I cannot prove that.\r\n \r\nIn the red wines I will sometimes use an albumin based fining agent made from egg whites and occasionally I will use a gelatin based fining agent that could be made from animal products.\r\n\r\nIn white wines I occasionally, although infrequently, use a isinglass based fining agent and I may use a tiny amount of dry (dehydrated) non-fat milk. In white juice prior to fermentation, I may use an animal derived gelatin based fining agent also.\r\n \r\nIn the future I hope to be able to use plant derived proteins to replace some of these agents, however they are not yet approved for use in wines in the United States.\"\r\n",

Generally no gelatin remains in the wine because it reacts with the wine components, as it clarifies, and forms a sediment which is removed by filtration prior to bottling. Exceptions to this are a few of our premium wines that undergo minimal or no filtration prior to bottling and therefore may not be completely free of animal products.\"",

With international safety standards, consumer health considerations and also wine presentation, however, wine needs to be stabilized from a microbiological standpoint. Lees and excess tannins need to be removed from wine to make it fit for sale, which involves a process called fining, or clarification.\r\n\r\nIn order to minimize loss of colour and flavour, and also ensure no off-flavours are added to the wine, at Concha y Toro we use the most wine-friendly fining agents possible.  Depending of the state of the must, in the case of white wines, and the young wine, in the case of reds, we use the minimum amount of animal derived proteins or minerals possible for fining. Prior to bottling, all flocculated protein residues are filtered off. In other words, while animal proteins may be employed, the final wine is effectively protein free. Therefore, at the end of the day it is a matter it is matter of consumer choice. Concha y Toro will use viable non-animal derived fining agents where possible. \"",

I did try egg white fining experiments in the lab but they failed miserably, so I won't be doing that.\r\n\r\nI guess the short answer to your question would be-  No, we do not use animal products in our wines.  Drink and enjoy them!\r\n\r\nAdditional company email:\r\n\"You'll be happy to know that our wines are indeed vegan friendly.

Then, the precious liquid is pumped into a large blending vat where it stays for 4 months before bottling in November.\r\n \r\nIn 2011, as I don\u2019t have enough wine to satisfy all my customers, I add one hectare of vines that I rent.\r\n \r\nI hope one day you will taste these \u201cterroir\u201d wines, fresh and fruity, quite different from stereotypical products generally tasted today throughout Bordeaux.\r\n \r\nIn 2010, export began to USA,Belgium, Qu\u00e9bec and Switzerland. \r\nEngland is added to the list in 2011.\"",

In using these agents the winemaker is further fine-tuning the structure of the wine. The use of small amounts of fining agents is generally necessary to ensure that the wine will be clear, stable and sound, have longevity and be enjoyable to taste.\r\n\r\nThe winemakers decide on which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year). It is important to note that despite fining agents being used during the wine making process, they are removed prior to bottling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Exceptions to this are a few of our premium wines that undergo minimal or no filtration prior to bottling and therefore may not be completely free of animal products.\"",

            "notes":"UPDATE: January 2010\r\n\"Gelatine has traditionally been associated with quality wines. Indeed, gelatine appears to be one of the clarifiers with greater agglutinating capabilities, and more selective power in the fining of wine. \r\nIn addition to that, gelatine is used in very low doses (average dose is 1 gr. per 100 liters of  must). We are talking about one gram of a transformed, purified, and sanitarily harmless product. On top of that, gelatine is eliminated from the wine by filtration, after agglutinating with the existing colloidal materials in the wine. \r\nAnother advantage of gelatine is that it offers high productivity during the filtration due to its agglutinating power. Otherwise, a couple of things could happen:\r\n\u2022\twine filtration cycles would be considerably shorter, increasing at the same time the filtration costs.\r\n\u2022\tit considerably would increase the volume of filtering earth needed with the inevitable environmental damages that this represents. \r\nFor the production of our Cava, we use both our own base wines and wines selected from other wineries. Some of these wineries have implemented modern methods to separate the lees (Mosto fining) based on modern flotation systems. One of the advantages of these systems is the elimination of filtering earths and, therefore, reducing the environmental impact. One of the key elements in this system is the use of the gelatine. \r\n<B>It is for these reasons that we sincerely believe that using small amounts of gelatine in the transformation process of wine, should not have any effect on consumption by vegetarians.\r\nIn conclusion, if we were not allowed to use gelatine, we would have to carry out a rigorous study on the consequences over our products and facilities. This would involve an important work of advising and control over our suppliers, which some of whom have adapted their systems to the separation of lees process described previously.</B>\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"Our wines are not suitable for vegans since we use a clarifying agent that has egg whites. \"\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"Our wines are not suitable for vegans since we use a clarifying agent that has egg whites.\"\r\n\r\n",

Generally no gelatin remains in the wine because it reacts with the wine components, as it clarifies, and forms a sediment which is removed by filtration prior to bottling. Exceptions to this are a few of our premium wines that undergo minimal or no filtration prior to bottling and therefore may not be completely free of animal products.\r\n\r\nTreatment of wines with milk or egg products is a common wine industry practice and is done by winemakers as needed to provide the appropriate treatment and clarity to the wine. These milk or egg products are removed during the filtering of the wines after treatment. At Gallo Family Vineyard we go one step further to verify that milk or egg products do not remain after filtration by testing each lot of wine that is treated.",

I stumbled across www.barnivore.com this morning, and decided I would write you. My husband's wines are certified organic, and he uses no animal products in either the vinification process or the filtering process. So, they would fit nicely into the philosophy of your company's website. \r\n\r\nHis production is mostly made up of white wines (Cupidone, Sauvagine, Roucaillat, Rocalhan and Djebel), but he also produces one \"gris\" (which is similar to a ros\u00e9) called Gris-gris. They are sold under the domaine name of Hautes Terres de Comberousse, and we are represented in the US by Neal Rosenthal at Mad Rose Group Ltd (www.madrose.com). \r\n\r\nIf you have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or my husband, Paul (he speaks English quite well) at paul@comberousse.com. You may also browse our website at www.comberousse.com\r\n\r\nI raise a glass to your efforts at clearing the muddy waters of modern day alcohol consumption.",

We clarify all of our wines and meads with a product made from dried seaweed and another product made from volcanic clay.\r\nIn addition to making wines, we make meads which would not be considered vegan friendly because meads are made with honey.\r\nSo, all of our wines are vegan friendly and both our wines and our meads are vegetarian friendly.\"\r\n\r\n",

I\u2019m actually a vegan and one of the things I was most excited about when I started working here in 2006 was how many of the wines were made without the use of animal products and how receptive the winemaking staff was to trying to cut down even more on how many were.  We maintain a special section of our website that only lists our vegan wines: http://www.huntwines.com/Vegan-Wines.  On that page you will also find a link to a chart that details which wines are made with and without animal products.  If the wine does contain any animal products, it is listed specifically on that chart.  Only one wine is made outside our facility, our Chardonnay Champagne, and we are unsure if any animal products are used in its production and consequently do not list it as a vegan-friendly wine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm writing to let you know that the wines at Hunt Country Vineyards, located in Upstate NY, are vegan (with only a couple exceptions, I'm still working on those ones).  I've been working at Hunt Country since 2006 and have been asking them ever since to make their wines vegan and we finally got there with the last two vintages - 2006 & 2007!.  Please visit the following link for more information <a href = \"http://www.huntwines.com/hcv_vegan_wine.html\">http://www.huntwines.com/hcv_vegan_wine.html</a> and feel free to contact me with any questions.

There are a few selected wines that we fine with refined protein made from animal based products.  The fining agents are mixed with the wine to remove specific compounds.  None of these fining agents are soluble and are removed by a diatomaceous earth filtration.  The final product is then filtered through a 0.22 micron membrane that removes all particles, bacteria or microorganisms.\r\n \r\nBecause wine is a natural based product whose characteristics vary from vintage to vintage, we treat each wine and each vintage differently.  The fining agents that we use may be used in some wines for some vintages and then not used for the same wine the following year.  Due to the possibility of blending of very small amounts from vintage to vintage (5% or less is allowable by law), we cannot assure with 100% certainty that any wine has been produced without using any animal based products.\"",

I don't know if you are referring to our Chardonnay or our Cabernet so I will attempt to answer both.\r\n\r\nChardonnay:  we use a combination of bentonite (earth based ) which is a montmorillonite clay that is used to drop out any protein that may cause a haze in our white wine.  For the juice, prior to fermentation, a combination of both bentonite and casein (a milk derived protein) is used which softens the astringent nature of our wine by minimizing the effect of the skins from the grape pressing.  The sediment (lees) from the deposition of the fining agent and the proteins, phenolics from the juice are racked (drawn) off and sent out for disposal (actually another winery uses the settlings). Of course our Chardonnay is filtered prior to bottling.\r\n\r\nCabernet:  the only fining agents we use are protein/animal based: gelatin and egg white.  The gelatin is used in very small quantities and helps remove amorphous material as well as microbial (yeasts and malolactic bacteria) that cloud the wine.  Fresh egg whites (not the yolk) is added as a way of balancing out the oak tannins and the fruit derived tannins.  It is a very common procedure used throughout the world; but some winemakers elect not to use egg whites as they fear it will remove flavor components.  We use egg whites because we feel the flavor components are enhanced.  I don't know if it is possible for residual egg whites to be present in our wine.  We filter our wine prior to bottling and after fining (0.65 microns absolute- which means nothing passes through the filter larger than 0.65 microns.  This is to eliminate any residual yeast and most malolactic bacteria) so I would imagine that the bound egg white with the tannin complex is removed.\"",

However because it can be confusing to what are what are not vegan wines of my portfolio I would never call my wines vegan.

On our red wines we will use either gelatin or egg whites are used on extremely tannic red wines.  The fining amounts are quite miniscule and range between 1/16 - 1/8 #/1000 gallons of wine for gelatin.  Food grade egg whites are purchased in bulk from reputable suppliers, similar to what would be purchased by restaurants and bakeries.  Historically, 1-2 egg whites per barrel are used to fine red wines in France, the equivalent of 1 - 2 #/1000 gallons.  Here at Markham Vineyards, we use only 1/2 - 1 #/1000 gallons.\r\n\r\nWhile I wish that I could recommend at least one wine that would pass in a vegetarian diet, I am unable to make that claim\"",

( I would have to double check this, but cannot do it right now as I am on vacation )\r\n \r\nSo I believe all our white wines fall in the vegan category at the moment.\r\n \r\nAs an aside, I think it is important that our customers are aware of the distinction between additions made to the wine, and fining agents which act on the wine, but importantly do not stay in the the wine.\r\n \r\nAn example of an addition, would be Tartaric acid, which is an additive to the wine and stays in the wine.\r\n \r\nFining agents include skim milk, egg whites and gelatin, which act on the wine but do not stay in solution. I appreciate that to vegans, this still means animal product has come into contact with the wine and therefore they cannot consume it, but I have met many people who think that these products are added to the wine and become part of it's structure, which is incorrect.\r\n \r\nI think it is always wise to check with individual wineries first, before making a purchasing decision, unless it is marked on the bottle that the wine is suitable for vegetarians and /or vegans.\"",

            "notes":"Company email (July 2012):\r\n\"Although we nave not used animal ingredients or products in recent years, we cannot easily make a list of Nissley wines that are without them.  The main\r\nreason is that we make many blends, and the blends can change with each new vintage.  Some of the juice comes from sources other than our own vineyards, and those sources might use animal products.\r\n\r\nThere is currently a trend toward using a \"juice flotation\" method at harvest, which introduces gelatin to the juice.  We plan to begin using this for our 2012 vintage.\r\n\r\nIn summary, although some of the wine we currently sell might be vegan friendly, it would be better to omit Nissley wine from your list, to avoid confusing your readers.\"\r\n",

On various white wines and Rose\u2019, We have on rare occasions had to use fining agents to remove undesirable characters from the wine. It is rarely done here and I seriously doubt if any of the fining material is left in the wine as it\u2019s purpose of fining is to attract the elements we want to remove and have them settle to the bottom of the tank, and the wine racked off the top.  Also, All of our whites end up being cold stabilized and sterile filtered before bottling which would greatly reduce any chance of any residual fining agent existing in the wine.\r\nWe attempt to avoid fining and manipulation of any wine in an attempt to allow the true character of the vintage and varietal to shine.  Of the 10 wines we are currently serving, not a one has been fined but we do have two wines in the cellar that have been fined because of the mildew pressures of the late harvest in 2010. This is the first time since the 2003 vintage that we have had to fine any juice.\"\r\n",

Well, we had to add some sugar in 2007.\r\n\r\nBackground on animals and wine: basically, animal products are added because the winemaker is trying to use protein to make other chemicals such as tannins fall out of solution.  This is almost exclusive to red wines.  When we fine white wines, we are trying to remove protein, so we are adding things such as bentonite clay.\r\n\r\nThe hotter the climate the grapes are grown, the more pressure there is to use fining agents on red wine.  Hot climates increase the skin to weight ratio at harvest, meaning the grapes have more tannin in them.\r\n\r\nWe don't fine our red wines: meaning no ox blood, isinglass, milk protein, egg whites, etc.  We have found that patience and time in the barrel address the needs.  We sometimes add Stabavin to our white wines, which is Gum Arabic.  I don't think that is prohibitive to vegan diets, but thought I'd disclose it since you're more qualified to judge.\"\r\n\r\nIn conversation with winemaker:\r\n\"All wines vegan\"\r\n\r\n",

We not only have the privilege of producing some of the region's most critically acclaimed wines, but also we pride ourselves in leading the way for conservationism in viticulture. What this means at Querciabella is that respect for the environment and animal life is central to the way we work during all phases of wine growing and production.\r\n\r\nWhile Querciabella has long been a benchmark of sustainability, converting to organic viticulture in 1988 and subsequently transitioning to biodynamics in 2000, the winery's owner Sebastiano Cossia Castiglioni, an outspoken animal rights activist, decided to ban all animal-derived products from the estate in 2007. As a result of our rigorous 100% Vegan policy, we have eliminated the use of animal products not only from the cellar but from the vineyards as well, relying exclusively on the use of cover crops for soil management\"",

All of these are filtered out in the end, but some vegans prefer that nothing animal be used whatsoever, so I thought I should be totally up front with you on this matter.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (November 2011):\r\n\"Yes, all of our wines are fined with either egg whites or isinglass, and sometimes gelatin. We process all of our wines here at the winery in Healdsburg, CA.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"The use of fining agents in winemaking to make wine taste/smell/look better is an ages old practice. Fining can eliminate bitterness, astringency, brown color, cloudiness, and other things best left out of wine. After the fining agent is added to wine, it clings physically or electrostatically to whatever protein or other targeted substance in the wine, and gravity generally brings it to the bottom of the storage vessel. The wine can then be drawn off the sediment, and may or may not be subjected to filtration. Some fining agents are \"earth\" based, and some are \"animal\" based. While theoretically no fining agent will end up in the final wine, strict adherents to some versions of vegetarianism would prefer not to make use of any product if animal derived substances were used during processing.\r\nFining is never done formulaically. Rather, if a wine might be subject to some improvement in, let's say astringency, then a representative sample of the wine is trialed under laboratory conditions with a variety of fining agents in varying amounts that are known to reduce astringency. The four best fining agents to reduce astringency are all animal based: egg whites, gelatin, isinglass (from fish), and casein (from milk). Other commonly used fining agents include bentonite (a clay), Sparkolloid (from algae), and activated carbon. Keep in mind that fining is an optional tool, and if a wine is delicious as it is, it may not require fining at all.\r\nSo what's a vegan to do?\r\nGenerally, red wines are more likely (but not necessarily) to have been fined for astringency with an animal based product than white wines. Some red wines are bottled as \"unfined\" and these are really the only prudent choice for a strict vegan. White wines, too, are sometimes fined with casein or isinglass, so it is always recommended that vegans contact a winery directly to learn what wines are best suited to them.\r\nOf the current releases of Rodney Strong Vineyards wines, vegans should be comfortable enjoying our 2007 Charlotte's Home Sauvignon Blanc, and our 2007 Sonoma County Chardonnay, both of which were finished only with \"earth\" based fining.\"",

I have also noted which ones are certified organic.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"-Red wine we make our premiums with the free run fraction, which doesn't have the harsh tannin of the press fraction.  Our premium free run reds are bottled unfined, unfiltered, making all of our top reds Vegan Friendly. However the press red, in our case (Tumbleweed Red) is fined with egg white to strip tannins.That is our only fined red.  Other fining agents strip the colour from red.\r\n\r\n-  White wines I usually just use bentonite, but again our premiums are generally free run, or very lightly pressed to avoid astringency, and the bentonite is sufficient to achieve protein stability when properly used.  The press white has more astringency from seeds, skins, and stems, and may require gelatin which is a very strong fining agent.  Improperly used it can easily strip a wine bare, and is rarely used in my cellar.  The single wine of ours that I have used gelatin on is the, as of yet unreleased, Tumbleweed White NV (accumlated years of press fractions).  On our 2006 Luminescence Chardonnay, we used some Isinglass in fining as a bit of an experiment, but I found that I much prefer to use bentonite for the compact lees and faster settling.  \r\n\r\nOur 2007 Luminescence is the only Certified Organic Chardonnay in BC at the moment, definitely Vegan Friendly!  The 2008 will also be...\r\nThat would make all of the other Chardonnay vintages Vegan Friendly, as well as our Riewurztrafeleron*, previously Riewurztrafelser Blanc.  *Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Ehrenfelser, Auxerrois, Chardonnay, Semillon!  100% of the whites from Stoney Slopes Vineyard in OK Falls in one tank!  Vines over 20 years old.  This one was released in May and sold out in July since its inception.  That is the problem with single vineyard bottlings, you can't expand production! ;)\r\n\r\n-Icewine - Bentonite fining only. All Vegan Friendly.\"",

            "notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"Your inquiry into fining agents was forwarded to me.  You are correct in saying that many wineries use fining products in their wines but I think that it is much less than in the past.  I remember when I first started winemaking in the early 90\u2019s I used several of these products.  But now because of educational advances in grape growing and winemaking many of these products are unnecessary.  For example, in red wines these products were used to mellow out harsh tannins after the fermentation.  Because the vineyard canopies have been opened up to allow more sunlight onto the fruit these tannins are not as hard.  Also in the winery there is more attention to pump-over management and temperature of fermentation which reduces the extraction of these harsh tannins.  So, to answer your question here at St Francis we do not use any animal based products in our wines.\"\r\n\r\n...And later we got some clarification (no pun intended):\r\n\r\n\"Vegan friendly\"? Meaning do we like vegans? Of course!\r\n\r\nIf you are asking if our wines are vegan, I would say yes to all except the zinfandels, which SOMETIMES receive dosing of an egg-white product. The purpose is it eliminates certain killer yeast that can hinder fermentations. We've only used it on zins since they come in so ripe. That substance is immediately dropped to the bottom, and by the time the wine is bottled it has been through a couple rackings + sterile filtering so there would be no remnants whatsoever of the egg whites. But, to be truthful I would say no to the zins.\"",

            "notes":"Company email:\r\n\"Thanks for your question.   It's an interesting one.   The short answer - no we don't use animal products in making our wine.  The gentle way we grow, pick, and ferment our grapes leads to naturally balanced tannin levels, so we don't need to add animal proteins to achieve correct tannin levels.\r\n\r\nNow for the long answer:\r\nIt's true that animal proteins are frequently used in winemaking. Their function is usually to control the levels of tannins in the wine.  Tannins are complex molecules that react with proteins.  They are naturally produced by many types of plants as a natural defensive compound against pests and stressful conditions.  In wine, overripe or stressed grapes can produce large quantities of tannins while still on the vine, and these tannin levels can be exacerbated by rough handling of the grapes during fermentation in the winery. \r\n\r\nWhen tannins react with the proteins in your mouth, they produce a drying, gritty sensation.  In subtle quantities, tannins create a velvety texture to the wine;  in greater quantities the sensation is decidedly unpleasant.  That's why some winemakers regularly fine their wines to remove excess tannins.  The tannins react with the proteins in the fining agent and precipitate them to the bottom of the barrel, making the wines taste softer and more palatable.\r\n\r\nHowever, at The Eyrie Vineyards we moderate tannins naturally.  We carefully manage the amount of sunlight that falls on the fruit, keeping stress to a minimum while boosting ripeness.  Our organic spray program keeps the grapes free of mildews and molds that lead the plants to create defensive tannins.  Our deep rooted vines tap into perennial sources of water.  As a result, drought stress is minimized and so are tannins.  \r\n\r\nThe grapes are picked by hand, destemmed whole berry, pressed in old fashioned platen style presses, and aged in neutral oak barrels.    These gentle winemaking techniques preserve the fruit flavors and give us naturally balanced wines that require little intervention on the part of the winemaker.\"\r\n\r\n",

The answer, unfortunately, is not too clear. Our wine makers use various fining agents during the wine making process. Some of these products are suitable for vegans, however sometimes in order to get the wine just right, they add products such as gelatin, which I know is not something that is appropriate for vegans. The hard part is that it depends on how the wine making is going and how the particular \"recipe batch\" is going. The wine makers then decide which fining agents should be added to achieve the desired end result.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry we don't have a more specific answer but unfortunately, it does vary from vintage to vintage.

Your question brings up a very interesting issue.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, winemakers have used traditional, natural techniques to fine and filter their wines.  Some of these techniques involve animal byproducts including, for example, egg whites, which may be used and then removed in certain steps of the winemaking process.  This may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the centuries-old art of winemaking, however these practices are widely used to this day and often result in levels well below human detection - the scale of which is measured by single parts per million gallons or liters.\r\n\r\nWhile most would consider this level insignificant, we take the concerns of our vegan friends very seriously and in good conscience, do not claim our wines to be 100% vegan.  Although there are other wineries that may not make the same decision, we feel that honesty and integrity are the best winemaking techniques and hope our supporters enjoy the results!\"",

Should we do so in the future, we would consider adding a note on the label.  In fact, Canadian regulations will require us to do so in the not too distant future with respect to consumers who may have allergic conditions to these products.  A friend of mine has pointed out that some of our grapes do end up having wasps, fruit flies, earwigs, and other crawlies inadvertently included in the ferment.  While we handpick all our grapes, machine-picked grapes sometimes include birds.  Not sure how this effects the eligibility of wine in a vegan diet. We don't license to any other entity to produce our products.",

The excess compounds are removed with sterile filtration, that promotes the\u2028freshness of the wine, without animal products.\r\n\r\nClos LaChance has been making wine since 1992.

With international safety standards, consumer health considerations and also wine presentation, however, wine needs to be stabilized from a microbiological standpoint. Lees and excess tannins need to be removed from wine to make it fit for sale, which involves a process called fining, or clarification. \r\nIn order to minimize loss of colour and flavour, and also ensure no off-flavours are added to the wine, at Vi\u00f1a Maipo we use the most wine-friendly fining agents possible. Depending of the state of the must, in the case of white wines, and the young wine, in the case of reds, we use the minimum amount of animal derived proteins or minerals possible for fining. Prior to bottling, all flocculated protein residues are filtered off. In other words, while animal proteins may be employed, the final wine is effectively protein free. Therefore, at the end of the day it is a matter it is matter of consumer choice.\" \r\n\r\n",

When we do, the agents we use may be derived from egg whites or milk-based casein.\r\n\r\nSo unfortunately the short answer is no, for strict vegans our wines can't be guaranteed 100%.\"",

            "notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"Winexpert does not include any animal products in the juices and concentrates we use in our wine kits. The only reference I can find in regards to animal products in wine production is the very old rustic Italian practise of including a pound of horseflesh in a barrel of wine, to 'make it stronger'. That sounds really disgusting, and horses are for petting, not eating.\r\n\r\nOur fining agents are derived from animals. Isinglass is a colloidal protein made from the swim bladders of Cichlid fish, dried, processed and dissolved\r\nin a liquid. As a side-note, the bladders are a by-product of a food fishery in Africa and the entire enterprise is completely sustainable.\r\n\r\nThe Chitosan is a long-chain sucrose polymer made from the shells of crustaceans like prawns, crabs, lobsters and shrimp. Again, it is a by-product of a food fishery.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is simple to replace these products with Agar gelatine, derived from seaweed and easily available from health food stores. Dosage rates are\r\nproblematic, but I would start with two teaspoons of gelatine powder dissolved in a cup of water to start.\r\n\r\nThese product facts aside, it's important to note that many non-animal derived foods and beverages have significant sources of animal-derived products in them, as a consequence of where they are grown and harvested. To quote California winemaker and researcher Lum Eisenman,\r\n\r\n\"On average, one ton of California wine grapes contains seven pounds of dirt, one mouse nest, 147 bees, 98 wasps, 1,014 earwigs, 1,833 ants, 10,899\r\nleafhoppers and three pounds of bird droppings. In addition, the waxy coating on grape skins contains many microorganisms. Grapes are crushed without washing, so crushed grapes contain several non-grape substances and many microorganisms. Consequently, attempting to sterilize crush equipment seems a bit futile. The nitrogen (bird droppings) and protein materials (bugs) are consumed during fermentation by the yeast. When fermentation is complete, the dirt, bees wings, earwig tails, etc. settle to the bottom of\r\nthe fermenters, and much of the yeast and ugly stuff is left behind when wine is racked.\"",

By my understanding, all of our wines would qualify as vegan other than our Founder\u2019s Reserve Pinot Noir.  In that wine, we sometimes may use Lysozyme which is an enzyme product that is derived from chicken eggs. \"",
