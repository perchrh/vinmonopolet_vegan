This wheat – a most noble and pure grain source – adds the same richness and flavor to Grey Goose vodka that it brings to the finest French breads and pastries.\r\n\r\nSpring water, originating in the Massif Central Mountains, the heart of France, flows into the Cognac Region.\r\nIt is naturally filtered through champagne limestone resulting in exceptionally sweet and pure water.\r\n\r\nThe pure grain spirit undergoes a five step distillation process.  With each step, the true essence and character of the vodka is revealed.\r\n\r\nFERMENTATION\r\n\r\nOnce the wheat has been ground into a fine flour, it is mixed with water and enzymes, which convert the starch content into fermentable sugars (hydrolysis)\r\n\r\nAt this stage, using a yeast bespoke to Grey Goose, the fermentation process begins.  In order to obtain the same fermented wheat, we closely monitor the temperature of the fermentation throughout the whole process.\r\n\r\nThe temperature is maintained by circulating the product in a loop with cold water\r\n\r\nDISTILLATION\r\nProprietary continuous 5-step distillation process\r\n\r\nFocuses on maximizing and concentrating the flavor of the fine French wheat instead of stripping out impurities because we only use the very best natural ingredients\r\n\r\nThe temperature of each of the five columns is continually adjusted to enable reactions to be triggered at precise temperatures\r\n\r\nThe distillation is constantly monitored by measuring the temperature and pressure in the columns and the quality of the high proof spirit\r\n\r\nPURE SPRING WATER\r\nPure spring water is taken straight from the ground and blended with the spirit\r\n\r\nThe water travels over 400km from the Massif Central to Cognac\r\n\r\nNo need for filtration - naturally filtered through the Grande Champagne limestone\r\n\r\nGives it a softness and natural touch of sweetness\r\n\r\nBLENDING\r\nUnder the supervision of the maître de chai, the high proof spirit is blended with the pure spring water until it reaches the perfect strength and optimal taste\r\n\r\nTHE WORLDS BEST\r\nGrey Goose uses the best at every stage of its production process from the quality of its ingredients to its bottling technology.  From the sourcing of the wheat to the moment a bottle of Grey Goose leaves its home in Cognac, a total of 500 quality control checks are carried out\"","created_on":"2007-06-11T01:06:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2009-09-01T06:55:37.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":4501,"company_name":"Gristmill Distillers","tag":"Gristmill-Distillers","address":"NY-73 Scenic","city":"Keene","state":"New York","postal":"12942","country":"USA","phone":"","fax":"","email":"info@gristmilldistillers.com","url":"http://gristmilldistillers.com/","checked_by":"Michael","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (April 2016)\r\n\r\n\"We can happily tell you that there are no animal ingredients in any of our products, nor in our filtering process.

Spanish oak and American oak are both used to make casks for maturing Highland Park and each of these types of oak impart specific flavours to the spirit.\r\n\r\nMost of the Scotch whisky industry uses Bourbon barrels for maturation. At Highland Park Bourbon barrels are not routinely filled. Traditional oak casks are used; butts, puncheons or hogsheads – no barrels – seasoned with dry Oloroso sherry.\r\n\r\nThe oak source (American or Spanish) is of greater importance than the wine type. Spanish oak sherry casks give colour and dried fruit character whereas American oak sherry casks give vanilla and butterscotch flavours. Sherry casks are far more expensive but the view at Highland Park is that they are worth it for the character they give the maturing spirit. Typically, a sherry cask will cost 10 times as much as a Bourbon barrel.\r\n\r\nThe Edrington Group, proprietor of Highland Park, is the leading proponent of wood management within the Scotch whisky industry. It is estimated that up to 80% of the final flavours in bottled whisky can come from the wood. Sherry oak casks contribute to the distinctive richness and multi-dimensional complexity of Highland Park single malt Scotch whisky and are certainly a justifiable expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No sherry will be treated in this way [i.e. fined with animal ingredients] before it is filled into casks. This would be the same for all of our whiskies so we are all clear on the vegetarian front. We know this because we work with our forestry teams, coopers and sherry bodegas from start to finish and through these relationships we can monitor what is happening with every cask.\"","created_on":"2013-04-22T21:32:59.000-04:00","updated_on":"2013-04-22T21:32:59.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":71,"company_name":"Hiram Walker Distillery","tag":"Hiram-Walker-Distillery","address":"","city":"Purchase","state":"","postal":"NY","country":"USA","phone":"","fax":"","email":"http://hiramwalker.com/contact.php","url":"http://hiramwalker.com/","checked_by":"Brandy","doubled_by":"Mara","notes":"Company email (February 2013):\r\n\"Our Hiram Walker products would be considered vegan friendly.

Fermentation is the process whereby yeast converts the wort, which is a sugary solution extracted from the milled cereal grains, into an alcoholic wash( in effect a type of beer). The wash, which contains about 12% alcohol is then triple distilled to give a newly distilled spirit. After maturation of the spirit in oak cask for the minimum number of years this beverage can then be called Whiskey. The production of Jameson Irish Whiskey meets with the strict requirements of the IRISH WHISKEY ACT, 1980, the purpose of which is to define the production and labeling requirements of Irish whiskey and blended Irish whiskey and all other relevant legislation on the production of Irish Whiskey. None of these regulations allow the use of such products.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Thank you for taking the time to e-mail us. Jameson is vegan friendly.

This is made into a paper that the whiskies will then be passed through.\r\n \r\nAs this material is made from fossilised algae it does affect the vegan whisky consumer. If a whisky is un-chill filtered then you will have no problems with our whiskies.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2013):\r\n\"'Our usual response re suitability for vegetarians, vegans and those with Celiac is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are aware of the condition known as Celiac disease where a person cannot tolerate a protein called gluten found in many cereals. Whilst the raw material for The Famous Grouse production will include barley, maize and wheat there is no gluten in the finished product as it is removed at the distillation stage. \r\nIf an allergy is oats specific then you can be assured that this cereal is not used in Scotch Whisky production.  However, our knowledge base is in whisky and not medicine so if in any doubt you should consult your doctor, pharmacist or dietician.\r\nThere are no animal products used in our whiskies so The Famous Grouse is suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. \r\n\r\nRegarding your specific enquiry, our Master Blender advises that fining in the sherry industry is carried out after the sherry is removed from the cask so no animal products come into contact with the casks.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Craig (March 2013):\r\n\"Famous Grouse has Highland Park as a principle ingredient and all Highland Park is from sherry casks, one of the very few distilleries to do so.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Grouse\r\nThe single malt whiskies used in The Famous Grouse blend include the Edrington owned Highland Park and The Macallan.\r\n\r\nHighland Park\r\nhttp://www.highlandpark.co.uk/lda/\r\n\r\nSHERRY OAK CASKS\r\nThe type of wood from which the cask is made is the most important element in encouraging specific flavours which give this single malt its own distinctive character. Spanish oak and American oak are both used to make casks for maturing Highland Park and each of these types of oak impart specific flavours to the spirit.\r\n\r\nMost of the Scotch whisky industry uses Bourbon barrels for maturation. At Highland Park Bourbon barrels are not routinely filled. Traditional oak casks are used; butts, puncheons or hogsheads – no barrels – seasoned with dry Oloroso sherry.\r\n\r\nThe oak source (American or Spanish) is of greater importance than the wine type. Spanish oak sherry casks give colour and dried fruit character whereas American oak sherry casks give vanilla and butterscotch flavours. Sherry casks are far more expensive but the view at Highland Park is that they are worth it for the character they give the maturing spirit. Typically, a sherry cask will cost 10 times as much as a Bourbon barrel.\r\n\r\nThe Edrington Group, proprietor of Highland Park, is the leading proponent of wood management within the Scotch whisky industry. It is estimated that up to 80% of the final flavours in bottled whisky can come from the wood. Sherry oak casks contribute to the distinctive richness and multi-dimensional complexity of Highland Park single malt Scotch whisky and are certainly a justifiable expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No sherry will be treated in this way [i.e. fined with animal ingredients] before it is filled into casks. This would be the same for all of our whiskies so we are all clear on the vegetarian front. We know this because we work with our forestry teams, coopers and sherry bodegas from start to finish and through these relationships we can monitor what is happening with every cask.\"\r\n\r\nChris says (July 2011):\r\n\"Just thought that I would let you know that Famous Grouse whisky is Vegan - They have a FAQ on their website which lists it:\r\nhttp://www.thefamousgrouse.com/Content/pdf/faqs.pdf","created_on":"2011-10-04T22:58:37.000-04:00","updated_on":"2017-06-02T05:34:03.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":2291,"company_name":"The Glenrothes","tag":"The-Glenrothes","address":"c/o BB\u0026R Spirits Ltd, 3 St James’s Street","city":"London","state":"","postal":"SW1A 1EG","country":"England","phone":"","fax":"","email":"contactus@bbrspirits.com","url":"http://www.theglenrothes.com/uk/","checked_by":"Jordan","doubled_by":"Craig","notes":"Company email (April 2013):\r\n[Editor's note: Craig verified that \"sea shells\" as referred to in the May 2012 response would actually be diatomaceous earth, thereby making The Glenrothes vegan-friendly.]\r\n\"Diatomaceous earth also known as D.E., diatomite, is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that is easily crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder.\r\n \r\nDiatomaceous earth consists of fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae.

Products have to be free of animal flesh, meat or bone stock, animal carcass fats, gelatine, aspic or any other products resulting from slaughter;\r\n2.      Products and ingredients should not have been tested on animals;\r\n3.      Products must be GMO free;\r\n4.      Products must also be free from cross contamination with non-vegetarian products/ingredients in the production process.\r\n \r\nWhisky production satisfies points 1 and 2, and given companies do not use GM sources of cereals and caramel also point 3.  This leaves any possibility of cross contamination by animal products as the only issue of concern. \r\n\r\nSuperficially, the potential for cross-contamination would appear to apply to Scotch Whiskies that have been matured or ‘finished’ in sherry or other wine casks – products that when bottled might have been ‘fined’ with animal by-products.  However, this is not an issue for Scotch as any ‘fining’ of these other products occurs after the casks are disgorged prior to bottling.  Scotch Whisky producers use the empty casks not the ‘fined’ liquid. Thus this last point is also satisfied. \r\n\r\nVegans can therefore continue to enjoy their Teacher's Whisky.\"","created_on":"2018-05-06T09:01:05.000-04:00","updated_on":"2018-05-06T09:01:05.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":587,"company_name":"Woodford Reserve Distillery","tag":"Woodford-Reserve-Distillery","address":"7855 McCracken Pike","city":"Versailles","state":"Kentucky","postal":"40383","country":"USA","phone":"859-879-1812","fax":"","email":"http://www.woodfordreserve.com/contact-us/","url":"http://woodfordreserve.com/","checked_by":"Jeremy","doubled_by":"Makoto","notes":"Company email (January 2019)\r\n\"Because you have written about a health related matter, we recommend that you consult with your personal physician regarding your concerns.\r\n\r\n\"Woodford Reserve is made with natural ingredients that consist of corn, rye, malted barley, and water.
