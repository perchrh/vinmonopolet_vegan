The Monks' Wit uses the same ingredients but uses only two hops and one malted barley. It also has red wheat, white wheat, flaked oats, bitter orange peel, sweet orange peel, coriander, and another spice. For this beer, all the ingredients and sources are approved by the FDA.

The Eccentric Ale is more often than not, not vegan.By packaged beers I mean everything we sell out in the marketplace (bottles, kegs, mini cans and cask). We do some experimental beers at our pub, but those do not get out into stores.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"All of the beer that we package for distribution to bars \u0026 stores qualifies as vegetarian. Occasionally, we will make specialty batches that may contain honey for our own pub or selected festivals. The most prominent is Eccentric Ale, a beer we make once a year in a very limited quantity. Customers can ask any of the bartenders at the Eccentric Cafe in Kalamazoo for information about the specialty taps. I should specifically mention that our Bell's Double Cream Stout does not contain any dairy-derived ingredients: the name refers to the creamy texture, not actual cream or lactose. You can find a list of our major brands at http://www.bellsbeer.com/brands.asp.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2006-12-15: Gary from Bell's wrote in with a warning about Hopslam Ale:\r\nI am writing to update you as to the status of a beer we launched as a new fall seasonal. Called Hopslam Ale, it broadly falls into the category of Imperial IPA (we're not big on style guidelines here). It does, however, contain honey as a source of fermentable sugar. Language to that effect was left off the initial run of labels, but I believe that will be corrected next season. I have already revised my standard reply to questions on whether our beers are vegan, and the presence of honey should be stated on our website as soon as we publish the next revision.\r\n\r\nCompany email 2 via Rick:\r\nAll Bell's products are vegan, with these exceptions:\r\n\r\n(1) Hopslam Ale (contains honey)\r\n(2) Eccentric Ale (contains honey)\r\n(3) No \"specialty brews\" served at their bar should be considered vegan without consulting with the bartender/brewmaster, as others may contain honey.","created_on":"2006-08-30T23:20:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2018-01-23T05:52:01.000-05:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"id":4214,"company_name":"Belleville Brewery","tag":"Belleville-Brewery","address":"36 Jaggard Way","city":"London","state":"","postal":"SW12 8SG","country":"England","phone":"07712 298 273","fax":"","email":"info@bellevillebrewing.co.uk","url":"http://www.bellevillebrewing.co.uk/","checked_by":"Stephen","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (October 2015)\r\n\r\n\"Our bottles and kegs are vegan friendly.

In the UK, it seems that a fish based product is used to filter the beer.\r\n \r\nIn the rest of Europe, Kronenbourg is a brand of Carlsberg and brewed by Carlsberg in France (Obernai) and perhaps other breweries. In France, it seems that no animal based product is used.\r\n \r\nWhen Carlsberg and Heineken devided the spoils of the Scottisch and Newcastle take-over, Carlsberg got France and Heineken got the UK. For Kronenbourg a special agreement was made. The orginal Kronenbourg breweries are in France and belong to Carlsberg, but Heineken was allowed to keep the brand for a couple of years. Heinken was also in the dog house for the advert with Eric Cantona, because it's Kronenbourg is brewed in the UK instead of France. I was in Obernai recently and took a tour of the brewery where the guide explained this after a remark made by somebody from the UK.\r\n \r\nWhatever the Carlsberg and Heineken agreement is, it seems that Kronenbourg beer can be consumed in France - but not in the UK - by a true vegetarian.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (June 2014):\r\n\"Kronenbourg [UK] is not suitable for vegetarians as it is clarified using isinglass finings which are fish derived.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (May 2014):\r\n\"Vous nous avez contactés concernant une demande d’information sur la composition, le processus de fabrication et de filtration des bières Kronenbourg.\r\nNous vous informons donc que concernant nos produits Kronenbourg nous n'utilisons pas de produits d'origine animal dans la composittion, la fabrication et la filtration.\"\r\n[Google translation] \"You have contacted us regarding a request for information on the composition, manufacturing process and filtration Kronenbourg beers. \r\nWe inform you about our products Kronenbourg we do not use any animal product in composition, manufacturing and filtration.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (October 2011)\r\n\"Although Heineken UK products are not tested on animals, we treat our some of our beers with isinglass finings (a solution of collagen prepared from certain fish).

Isinglass  has  been  used  in  beers for centuries as a clarification agent during beer conditioning.  In keg and small pack beers, there  is  very  little,  if any finings left in the finished product as it settles  out  with  the  yeast,  and  any  residues  are removed during the filtration process.\r\n\r\nIn cask beers, however, finings is added to the beer when it is packaged to assist  the  settling  of  the  live yeast that is an integral part of cask conditioning.  Cask beers, then, will always have some finings in the cask, but  if the beer has been treated properly in the pub and isn't cloudy, the sediment  containing  the  majority of finings remains at the bottom of the cask and very little carries through to the finished product.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  fish  finings  work so well that all attempts by brewers to find  a suitable alternative have by and large been unsuccessful. There has been  no  concern over health aspects, as no consumer ill effects have ever been reported over the many, many years that finings have been used.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  conclusion drawn is that there is little, if any, finings in the  finished product, it is advised that as the product may contain traces of finings that we do not say it is suitable for vegetarians.'\r\n\r\nWith  regards  to  our  ciders,  three  of  our products, Strongbow Sirrus, Bulmers Original and Jacques use an animal product as a colouring material.

I believe all of the beer they sell there is vegan.\r\n\r\nAlso, occasionally some of our seasonal brews are prepared without finings -- the most recent example was this year's version of 'The Grinch'.  This really depends on the beer, however -- if it is a dark enough beer and a bit of haze is acceptable in the final product then we won't use isinglass.  More often than not we do use it though.\r\n\r\nFinally, all of our cask-conditioned beers are prepared without isinglass, in a vegan-friendly manner.  We tap one of these casks every Friday at our brewery.

Although our website states that our cask conditioned beers use isinglass, this is no longer true. A vegan substitute, Biofine Clear, is currently used to filter our cask beers. Here's some more info in case it's helpful:\r\n\r\nNone of our beers contain traces of milk, or corn. However, there is some residual sugar: glucose, maltose, and maltotriose. These sugars are derived from malted barley. We do not add sulfites as a preservative to our beer. Any sulfur formation is a result of the fermentation. Therefore, all of our beers are low in sulfites. Brooklyn Lager would be a good example of low sulfites, which has less than 1 ppm (the average sulfite content for wine is 80 ppm). Typically, sulfur dioxide levels in our beer are less than 1 ppm. The exceptions are Winter Ale, Black Chocolate Stout, Black Ops and Monster Ale, which have levels of 5-7 ppm of sulfur dioxide.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Lucky for you, we do not use isinglass in our filtering process, so none of our kegged or bottled beers have any animal products in them. A word to the wise though, if you happen to stop at a restaurant or our Brewery when we have casked beer, those do use isinglass so be sure not to have that (a cask is naturally carbonated beer that is aged. it looks like a smaller rounder keg turned on it's side with tap on one end).\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"The only beers we produce that contain any animal products are our cask-conditioned ales (on the handpump or direct from the cask), which contain isinglass.

Here's what I can verify for certain:\r\nCrannóg Backhand of God Stout: Vegan\r\nCrannóg Red Branch Irish Ale: Not Vegan\r\nCrannóg Gael's Blood Potato Ale: Not Vegan (because of isinglass… not human blood haha)\r\nCrannóg Insurrection IPA: Not Vegan\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (February 2013):\r\n\"Unfortunately the big bosses here (Rebecca and Brian) are on vacay for the next couple weeks, but having talked to them about this very topic last week, I feel confident in fielding your question. We have four main beers that we brew year round. Of those, only our Backhand of God Stout is vegan (isinglass is used in the other three). Crannog Ales is a small Certified Organic Brewery in Sorrento, BC and is not manufactured anywhere else in the world!\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (August 2012):\r\n\"We use Isinglass as a fining in all our beers EXCEPT the Backhand of God Stout. We do not use any animal ingredients in any of our beers otherwise, except for the occasional cask which uses honey, and which is stated on the beer. You are highly unlikely to get any cask ales from us anyway, so not to worry about it.\r\n \r\nWe respect all life, animal or vegetable. Our ethic is to live and brew in a way which supports a vital ecosystem, including livestock, wild animals, insects, soil biota, vegetation etc. We are aware that our lives depend on the lives of everything around us, regardless of class or family.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2012)\r\n- We are certified organic - all our beers, all the time. No non-organic ingredients.\r\n- We are fully committed to ethical and responsible farming and brewing. Our brewery is as close to zero-waste as current recycling availability allows, we have reduced our water use to 1/8 that of most breweries, and we re-use our wastewater on the farm. We have reduced packaging and re-use almost everything in the brewery. Both the farm and the brewery are certified organic, and our primary focus is to build and regenerate the eco-system within which we operate. We build soil through our brewery and farm processes.\r\n- We use isinglass as a processing aid in all our beers except the Backhand of God Stout. It is a processing aid that drops out of the beer before packaging, and is not present in the final beer.\r\n- We do not pasteurize or filter our beers, so that they remain live products with active yeast and all the flavour we work so hard to put there in the first place.\r\n- We use honey in some of our seasonal ales, indicated in the name or description of the beer. The honey comes from hives on the farm, which surrounds the brewery. (By the way, honey is produced by bees, it's not an \"animal\" ingredient. Just like wool is produced by sheep, they are not harmed in the shearing, and their health depends on being shorn annually!)\r\n- We continue to institute energy-saving methods in the brewery, from water re-use to heat-on-demand systems so that our footprint remains sustainable.\r\n- We raise livestock on the farm, as their manure and grazing assists in the creation of healthy soil and a viable eco-system. Without their input, our soil would become depleted and we would need to use chemical fertilizers! Responsible and ethical livestock rearing is extremely important to us. \r\n\r\nWe manufacture only in our own brewery, nowhere else. Why? Because the whole focus of what we do is sustainability, and exporting/outsourcing is simply not environmentally sustainable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only beer that we make that adheres to your requirements would be the Backhand of God Stout, which uses no isinglass. It is widely available throughout southern BC - there's a list of where you can get it on our website.","created_on":"2012-03-31T08:37:47.000-04:00","updated_on":"2013-02-16T15:51:05.000-05:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"id":2560,"company_name":"Crate Brewery and Pizzeria","tag":"Crate-Brewery-and-Pizzeria","address":"Queen's Yard","city":"London Borough of Tower Hamlets, E9","state":"","postal":"","country":"England","phone":"","fax":"","email":"info@cratebrewery.com","url":"www.cratebrewery.com","checked_by":"Kevin","doubled_by":"Carole","notes":"Company email (October 2015):\r\n\"...unfortunately we don’t as yet produce any vegan beer.

So here are some answers:\r\n1.  We do not use any animal products in any of our beers.\r\n2.  Our bottled beers available at the LCBO are Hoptical Illusion Almost Pale Ale, Smashbomb Atomic IPA, Netherworld Cascadian Dark Ale, Flying Monkeys Amber Ale, and Antigravity Light Ale.  \r\n3.  Our filters use diatemaceous earth (DE)--a filtration sand comprised of sedimentary rock which may contain the crushed skeletons of prehistoric critters. Is that bad? We do not use isinglass or gelatin.\r\n4.  We also us filtration powder that is DE and a powdery perlite (crushed alumino-silica rock or naturally occuring silicon dioxcide).\r\n5.  Our casks are unfiltered, and unless we call something a honey beer, there is no honey. We made a cask of Smash Jezebel HoneyBomb for C'est What? last spring, but it was just a one-off, specialty experiment which was a sweetened riff on our  Smashbomb Atomic IPA.  That's the only honey we've ever used.  Honestly, we didn't love it.\r\n6. We never use eggs.  \r\n7. We have never brewed a milk stout with lactose --the unfermentable sugar found in milk.  So NO to milk.\r\n8. We brew all our own beer, ourselves,  right here in downtown Barrie. None of our beers are contract brewed or produced off this premises.\r\n9.  We do have some new beers coming down the pipe with turbinado sugar, maple sugar, Madagascar Bourbob Vanilla pods, beers filtered through oak staves . . .  everything I'm thinking of  are all of plant-origins.  Hey, I'm thinking we're vegan!\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, we will soon (by mid 2012) be labelling all allergens in our beers.  Maybe a vegan notification might be useful, too.  If we have to design new labels, why not?\r\n\r\nHope this info was useful, and don't hesitate to ask more questions.  I do not know much about what counts as officially vegan, but I'm developing the idea that our beers are all natural and safe.  We do use varieties of organic hops and nonGMO'd malts.  Not all hop varieties are grown organically, but we try to get them whenever we can.\"\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\n\"None of our LCBO bottled beers have sugar in them.  Barley, hops, water, and yeast.  That's all. We get all our flavours from the varieties of hops and the different types of roast and malted barley or different strains of yeast. \r\n\r\nOf course, that being said, Antigravity has undergone a recipe tweaking recently, so I better check on it.  They're brewing a batch with a different, sweeter  malt, but I don't think anything else was added.  Adjunct or additives are not our style.   And, yes, we do brew a light ale --for slow-pitch softball and lawn mowing -- but the nice hoppy craftier brews you'd find at C'est What? are all vegan approved.  \r\n\r\nOf the beers in the LCBO, Hoptical Illusion Almost Pale Ale, Netherworld Cascadian Dark Ale, and Flying Monkeys Amber Ale are definitely vegan according to your criterion.  Smashbomb Atomic IPA would be vegan, too.  No adjunct or additives in Smashbomb --just buckets and buckets of hops!  You can get that one on tap in a lot of micro-friendly pubs.\r\n\r\nThe casks would be a different story and should be evaluated on a case by case basis.  Any info on Belgian Candi Sugar (yes, \"candi\" spelled with an \"i\"). It's brown and raw-looking, like hardened molassass, and it does have that rich molassass-y flavour.   C'est What? will be getting a 16-18%ABV Imperial Baltic Porter from us called Divinity in the next few weeks, and I know it has Belgian Candi Sugar in it to help get the alcohol content up there.  It tastes like a port --delicious!  The Belgian Candi Sugar is the only wild card for you in that one.  Hope you can drink it, because it is a whole new level in craft beer!\"","created_on":"2011-04-26T14:54:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2011-05-09T17:07:43.000-04:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"id":5038,"company_name":"Foam Brewers","tag":"Foam-Brewers","address":"112 Lake Street","city":"Burlington","state":"Vermont","postal":"","country":"USA","phone":"","fax":"","email":"info@foambrewers.com","url":"http://www.foambrewers.com/","checked_by":"Chris","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (December 2016)\r\n\r\n\"Yes, our beers are vegan friendly!

We have a 7 bbl brewery here and serve beer on site only (no distributing), although we do fill half-gallon jugs to go. \r\n \r\nThe only ingredients we use here are natural and we don't use honey (although we have considered it).  The ingredients that I have used up to this point are as follows:  barley, hops, yeast, water, Irish moss, and unpasteurized apple cider.\r\n \r\nWe don't filter our beer at all.  We use no isinglass, no gelatin, no bone char, etc.  If you are wondering about Irish moss, it is all natural, made from seaweed.  Irish moss \"is a species of red algae (Chondrus crispus) which grows abundantly along the rocky parts of the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America\". ( from Wikipedia)  We use Irish moss as a kettle coagulant.  Carageenan is the protein found in Irish moss which makes it useful to us brewers.  Carageenan carries a net negative charge on its particle.  Most of the proteins that leach out of the malted barley during the mashing process carry a net positive charge.  Adding Irish moss in the boil (the sweet liquid, wort, is boiled for stability and hop utilization) causes the positively charged proteins to coagulate together around the negatively charged carageenan particles.  This causes protein \"clumps\" to form which then have a much easier time falling to the bottom of the tank.  So, you could call Irish moss an all natural way to help clarify beer.  Every brewer I know uses it to some degree.\r\n \r\nAnyway, we at the Gardner Ale House take pride that our beer is not only all natural, but unfiltered as well, leaving the beer as wholesome and fresh as could possibly be.  Our beer might not always be perfectly clear as a result, but the flavor is unbeatable, and it is nice to know that we can call our beer vegan.  I hope this helps your list.  By the way, right now we have 6 of our own fresh house brews on tap: Facelift IPA, Oma's Altbier, Naked Stout, Snow Slaker Winter Lager, Summer's End Kolsch, and William Tell's Apple Ale.

You asked if we use Isinglass in our beer.  We only use Isinglass in our yeast propagation system.  Once a Granite City brewery uses one of our yeast starter batches, they then re-use the yeast produced from their fermentation for several generations so only the first batch had a tiny (if any) amount of Isinglass in it.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming from your Twitter handle that your are asking in regard to vegetarian issues.  I've had this discussion often with vegetarian, beer-loving friends of mine.  Here is some interesting numbers about the amount of Isinglass used in our beer:\r\n\r\nThe percentage of Isinglass used in the yeast propagation is 0.012%.  That 0.012% is then added to 465 gallons of wort to produce beer.  Then the yeast (along with the Isinglass) settles out and is removed.  Are there perhaps molecules of animal protein somewhere in the beer?  Perhaps.  I would argue that you get more animal protein by sitting in a leather chair.  \r\n\r\nIf you are a vegetarian, I respect your desire to avoid animal products in any amount.  If you are okay with the possible microscopic amount that may be in some batches, then just be sure to stick with our lagers.  The Ales are not filtered so we use gelatin to settle the yeast.  Again, gelatin is used as a catalyst in settling so by definition isn't considered an ingredient as it is removed from the final product.\"","created_on":"2014-09-21T11:42:03.000-04:00","updated_on":"2014-09-21T11:42:03.000-04:00","status":"Not Vegan friendly","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"id":2106,"company_name":"Grans Bryggeri AS","tag":"Grans-Bryggeri-AS","address":"Hegnasletta 4","city":"Sandefjord","state":"","postal":"3206","country":"Norway","phone":"+47 33 48 25 00","fax":"+47 33 48 25 25","email":"post@grans.no","url":"http://www.grans.no","checked_by":"Per","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (February 2012):\r\nTranslated and summarized: \"All our beers are vegan friendly.

We do not use any of the filter aids that you’re talking about here at Great Lakes , so our beers are definitely vegan friendly!  I would be careful as you begin your exploration into the beer world as there are many craft brewers that do use them. I would be especially careful if you go to a place that is serving cask-conditioned beer.  This is a very popular way to serve beer these days but the use of finings is very common with these beers.  We do a cask here at Great Lakes on occasion and do not use any, so if you’re looking to try one, keep an eye out on our website.  Thanks again!  I hope you find some of our beers to your liking!\r\n\r\nFrom Greer:\r\n\"I called them directly and asked to speak to their Brewmaster, and they transferred me to some fellow named Mark.  He confirmed that they DO use honey in their Christmas Ale, but seemed perplexed when I asked if any other animal ingredients were used in the clarifying process. I then said, \"Gelatin? Isinglass?\"  His retort was, \"Um...no? We use a synthetic clarifier called PVPP\"  (which stands for polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, which also acts as a stabilizer).\"","created_on":"2006-08-30T23:39:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2017-09-14T06:37:34.000-04:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"id":1602,"company_name":"Great Newsome Brewery","tag":"Great-Newsome-Brewery","address":"Great Newsome Farm, South Frodingham, Winestead","city":"Hull","state":"E.

Then I asked very clearly and specifically about bottled Extra Stout brewed and bottled in New Brunswick. After checking for me the rep was able to very clearly confirm that this product, brewed in New Brunswick, didn't not use isinglass in it's production and was in fact suitable for vegans. whew!\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2013):\r\n\"You will be pleased to hear that we do not use any animal products in our beer or the production of it. \r\n \r\nThe fine beers we brew (and import) are brewed with these all-natural ingredients:  water, barley malt, hops, yeast, and cereal grains.\r\n \r\nThe water we use is drawn from the municipal drinking supply and carbon filtered for astounding purity.  Our brewing water must free of any taste, color, or aroma before brewing.\r\n \r\nBarley malt is the “soul” of beer.  Our beers are brewed with pale two or six row barley malt.  Roasted barley gives the color to our beers – lightly roasted barley makes pale golden beers like Labatt Blue or Budweiser.  For Keith’s Red we use barley roasted a little longer, until the sugars start to caramelize.  Roast them yet more?  Keith’s Dark.\r\n \r\nHops are the female flower bud of a perennial climbing vine, and are known as the “spice” of beer.  Hops are added in different stages of the brew kettle’s boil to give the beer aroma, bitterness, and to balance the flavor. \r\n \r\nYeast is the life of the brewing process.  We use our own pure-cultured yeast strains for fermentation – the yeast breaks down sugars into carbon dioxide and alcohol.  Our lagers use a bottom-fermenting yeast for a crisper, cleaner flavor.  Ales use a top-fermenting yeast for a more fruity, floral, lingering notes.\r\n \r\nMost of our beers are also brewed with a cereal grain, also known as an adjunct.  Some are brewed with corn for a sweeter taste.  Some use rice for a crisp, clean finish. \r\n \r\nBeyond this, some beers use special flavorings or spices for a truly unique flavor – like the essence of lime found in Bud Light Lime, or the coriander and citrus peel found in Keith’s White.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (October 2012):\r\n[from Labatt who brews Guiness Extra Stout in Canada] \"You will be pleased to hear that we do not use any animal products in our beer or the production of it.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (Feb 2012)\r\nI am writing to you in response to your recent email regarding whether Guinness and  it's suitability for Vegans.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your query however, we do use isinglass, a by product of the fishing industry, for fining all Guinness brewed beers. Isinglass is used widely in the brewing industry although it is extensively refined before use. Its sole purpose is as a fining agent to help remove yeast from our beer, while we accept that some minor traces of isinglass may subsequently remain in the finished product.\r\n\r\nWe are very happy with the technical performance of isinglass in removing yeast although we are conscious that its use may represent a barrier to consumption of our products to some. As part of our ongoing efforts to further improve the way we make our products, we are seeking alternatives to isinglass. To date, we have not found any alternative that is as effective and as environmentally friendly as isinglass for our product.\r\n\r\nCompany email (November 2011)\r\n\"In response to your inquiry, we would like to let you know that at this time, Guinness Black Lager is not suitable for vegetarians. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\"\r\n\r\nNote from William: March 2011 \r\n\"I know you have received conflicting information regarding the brewing of Guinness, and your level of exasperation is obvious from the Guinness entry.  Nonetheless, I tried to follow a logical thread that has been apparent from the beginning, when Guinness original explained that a certain product (Guinness Extra Stout for export to the U.S.) didn't use Isinglass as a fining agent and was vegan.  How could that be, I asked myself.  Well, I noticed that the Guinness Extra Stout was brewed in Canada.  So, I did some research and found that many of the online commentators at beer sites were wrong. Moosehead, not Labatt's, brewed it for the U.S.  \r\n\r\nThus, I contacted the actual brewers of Guinness Extra Stout that exported here, and their response follows: consumerinquiries@moosehead.ca\r\n\"Hello William,\r\nThank you for your inquiry. We do in fact brew delicious Guinness Extra Stout for export to the States right here in Canada’s most Irish city, Saint John. We do not make use of isinglass in any of our brewing processes, export or domestic. \r\nConsumer Affairs Coordinator\r\nMoosehead Breweries Ltd.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: (pamela.daly@diageo.com) March 2011\r\n\"All Guinness brands are free from animal matter. However, isinglass, which is a by-product of the fishing industry is used as a fining agent - i.e. used during processing to clarify beer. There should be little residue in the finished beer. Findings are removed by sedimentation and centrifugation. Therefore it would not be suitable for vegans.\r\nProduction processes in the UK are subject to strict UK/EU legislation and at present isinglass is the only fining agent suitable for stout, which has been approved in the UK. Any new fining agent, especially synthetic substitutes, would not be approved for food without rigorous testing both in Europe and by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. As yet there are no suitable alternatives available.\" \r\n\r\nCompany Email (diageona@consumer-care.net) : January 2011\r\n\"In reference to your inquiry, isinglass, a fish product, is used during the clarification process as a magnet to get rid of excess yeast. To the strict Vegan, this would be considered an animal product and therefore unsuitable. \r\nWe can inform you that Guinness does not contain eggs, dairy or honey. In regards to Kaliber, unfortunately we are unable to confirm this for you. \r\n\r\nCompany Email (diageona@consumer-care.net): January 2011\r\n\"In regard to your inquiry, please be advised that Guinness does not currently offer any vegan products.  We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\" \r\n\r\nCompany Email (diageona@consumer-care.net): January 2011\r\n\" We are more than happy to assist you with your inquiry.  The North American Guinness Extra Stout does not contain isinglass, nor are any animal products used in its manufacture.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email (diageoNA@consumer-care.net): May 2009\r\n\"In reference to your inquiry, isinglass, a fish product, is used during the clarification process as a magnet to get rid of excess yeast.

Isinglass, a fish product, is used during the clarification process as a magnet to get rid of excess yeast. To the strict Vegan, this would be considered an animal product and therefore unsuitable for Guinness products.  Since this applies to Guinness products, it is more likely that this also applies to the Guinness 250th Anniversary stout Edition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE FROM THE BARNIVORE ARCHIVES:\r\n....Jan 2009\r\n\"In reference to your inquiry, isinglass, a fish product, is used during the clarification process as a magnet to get rid of excess yeast.

Once again, thank you for contacting\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n....Jan 2009\r\nI showed them your web page and they explained (below is a small part of the email in case you want to quote it) that the extra stout is vegan and the draught is not, which explained the discrepancy. Hope that helps. James\r\n\r\n\"In regards to your inquiry, Guinness Extra Stout does not contain isinglass. Guinness Draught does contain isinglass in both bottles and the draught.\"\r\n\r\n.....Aug 2006:\r\n\r\nOur Consumer Relations department has informed us that the Guinness Extra Stout product that you will find in the North American market does not contain isinglass. I hope this is the answer you were looking for. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\n...But then we got this one in November:\r\n\r\nIn reference to your inquiry, isinglass, a fish product, is used during the clarification process as a magnet to get rid of excess yeast. To the strict Vegan, this would be an animal product and unsuitable.\r\n\r\nDid they not know about the Extra Stout?  Does this cancel out the previous message?  Who knows?\r\n\r\n...And then there's the standard reply:\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to contact us and for your interest in Guinness Draught nutritional information. In reference to your inquiry, isinglass, a fish product, is used during the clarification process as a magnet to get rid of excess yeast. To the strict Vegan, this would be an animal product and unsuitable. I hope this helps.

All ingredients are natural and from\r\nplant sources. No materials of animal sources are used. We don't use products of animal origin in the refining and filrating\r\nprocess. All our beer is filtered through kieselguhr filters (the calciferous\r\nskeletons of diatoms). When we first received questions from our vegan\r\nconsumers, this lead us to investigate: is a diatom a single cell animal or\r\nis it a plant? The American dictionary of biology says : Diatoms contain chlorophyll and are photosyntetic. In older classifications\r\nthey are identified as primitive plants. Because they are indeed plant-like in many respects, it is still common practice to use the term \"plant\".\r\n(Biological Science; Keeton; 3rd ed. (page 14))\r\nAccording to this description of the diatom, we can conclude that the cell is considered as a plant.\r\nThis makes it possible for us to call our beer vegan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNote from Karoliina (jan 2011) \r\n\"I contacted Desperados ( a tequila flavored beer) originated from france, and as I had to contact the french page, as the english one didn't seem to have a working e-mail this is the response I got from them, and they say that desperados does not contain any animal based product in the beer. as the beer is under the heineken group i can well believe that it might be vegan too then :)\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email: (Jan 2011) \r\n\"Nos produits ne contiennent aucun ingrédient d'origine animale.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: Jan 2010\r\nThank you for your recent email message.

Our Wytchmaker Rye IPA is made using an organic base malt, which makes up about 80% of the grist.\r\n\r\nOur beers are brewed exclusively at our brewery in Austin, and we have no plans to have them made anywhere else.  We are planning to do some future collaborations with other brewers who share our general philosophy, but any such beers that we brew will clearly state where they're made.\r\n\r\nI should also mention that while we don't use honey in any of our current recipes, it is an ingredient that we've considered and might work with in the future.

Otro que producto que utilizamos son sales de calcio (de origen mineral), que se utilizan para corregir la dureza de aguas muy blandas.\r\n\r\nDurante la filtración utilizamos tierras diatomeas, también un producto mineral que tiene como origen los esqueletos fósiles de algas microscópicas.\r\n\r\nAlgo que debes considerar es que en la industria cervecera se define como Ingrediente, a una materia prima que de hecho permanece en la cerveza, mientras que existen otros productos, como los clarificantes, que no se los considera ingredientes ya son removidos durante el proceso y no llegan al producto final. Ejemplos de estos son el Isinglass o la gelatina por ti mencionados.\r\n\r\nDe todas formas, nosotros no utilizamos isinglass, gelatina ni otros clarificantes de origen animal. Estos clarificantes se utilizan para acelerar la sedimentación de la levadura durante la maduración. En nuestro caso utilizamos levaduras que sedimentan bien de forma natural y además tenemos un tiempo de maduración prolongado para asegurar que la cerveza clarifique sin necesidad de apurarla.\r\n\r\nTampoco tenemos ninguna línea de cervezas que lleve miel.\r\nOtro tema que vale la pena aclarar es que a pesar de que en su origen las 'Cream Stout' llevaban suero de leche o recibían una adición de lactosa, nosotros no incorporamos ningún producto lácteo en nuestra stout, ni en ninguna de nuestras cervezas.\"\r\n\r\n[Google translation] \"In response to your query, the ingredients we use to produce Kross are: \r\n- Malted barley (domestic and imported blondes for the German caramel malts and roasted malts) \r\n- Hops, \r\n- Yeast \r\n- Water. \r\n\r\nAs is known, malt and hops are products of plant origin, while the yeast is a microscopic fungus. Another product use are calcium salts (of mineral origin), which is used to correct very soft water hardness. \r\n\r\nDuring filtration use diatomaceous earth, also a mineral product that has its origin in the fossil skeletons of microscopic algae. \r\n\r\nOne thing to consider is that the beer industry is defined as ingredient, a raw material fact remains in the beer, while other products, such as clarifiers, which are not considered ingredients and are removed during the process and not reach the final product. Examples are the isinglass or gelatin yourself mentioned. \r\n\r\nAnyway, we do not use isinglass, gelatin or other animal clarifiers. These clarifiers are used to accelerate the sedimentation of the yeast during ripening. In our case we use yeast that naturally settle well and also have a long maturation time to ensure that beer without having to rush you clarified. \r\n\r\nWe also have no line leading honey beers. \r\nAnother issue worth clarifying is that even though the 'Cream Stout' whey had originated or received an addition of lactose, we do not incorporate any dairy products in our stout, or any of our beers.\"\r\n","created_on":"2014-09-26T10:36:59.000-04:00","updated_on":"2014-09-26T10:36:59.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":703,"company_name":"Kuhnhenn Brewing Company","tag":"Kuhnhenn-Brewing-Company","address":"5919 Chicago Road","city":"Warren","state":"MI","postal":"48092","country":"USA","phone":"586-979-8361","fax":"","email":"http://www.kbrewery.com/contact/contact.html","url":"http://www.kbrewery.com","checked_by":"Kevin M","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"Once in a great while we try isinglass.\"","created_on":"2009-05-08T09:30:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2010-01-29T08:51:07.000-05:00","status":"Not Vegan friendly","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"id":3429,"company_name":"Kulmbacher Brauerei","tag":"Kulmbacher-Brauerei","address":"Lichtenfelser Straße 9","city":"Kulmbach","state":"","postal":"95326","country":"Germany","phone":"+49 (9221) 705-0","fax":"+49 (9221) 705-29270","email":"info@kulmbacher.de","url":"http://www.kulmbacher.de","checked_by":"Giulia","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (May 2014):\r\n\"alle Ihre Fragen kann ich mit nein beantworten.\r\nDie deutschen Brauereien brauen nach dem Reinheitsgebot, das ist unsere Verpflichtung.\"\r\n[Google translation] \"all your questions can I answer in the negative. \r\nThe German breweries brew after the Reinheitsgebot, that's our commitment.\"\r\n","created_on":"2014-06-12T23:14:50.000-04:00","updated_on":"2014-06-12T23:14:50.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":6262,"company_name":"Kulshan Brewing Company","tag":"Kulshan-Brewing-Company","address":"2238 James Street","city":"Bellingham","state":"Washington","postal":"","country":"USA","phone":"","fax":"","email":"info@kulshanbrewing.com","url":"https://kulshanbrewing.com/","checked_by":"Joshua","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (March 2018)\r\n\r\n\"We do not  use any animal derived finings, so yes our beers are vegan.

However, at this time, gelatin is the best option for clarifying our beer. While it doesn't end up in the final product we are aware that its use may be unacceptable to some folks.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me in the future regarding the vegan status of our beer. As I said, it has been a goal to eliminate all animal products from our production process.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2010):\r\n\"I wanted to let you know that we have been brewery vegan friendly for the last couple of weeks at our 51st Street Brewery.

Many brewers use a isinglass, or other shellfish derivative, for clarifying purposes after the beer has fermented before bottling or kegging.  I have personally done a lot of research on the subject, not because of the vegan angle, but because i know a few people, including a cousin, that are deathly allergic to shellfish.  It turns out that most of the clarifying derivatives on the market are refined to the point that there are no actual shellfish proteins present, which would cause allergic reaction, only specific minerals which act to \"cling\" to remaining particulate in the beer and drop it from suspension.\r\nThis information comes from the Medical Research Director at Purdue University.  As such, I do not think anyone's vegan status or allergies would necessarily be compromised, but we have decided to just avoid the use altogether.  The complete ingredients for our flagships are as follows...\r\nFarm Girl Saison:  malted barley, hops, pure beet sugar, orange peel, irish moss, belgian yeast, and water. Pale Ale:  malted barley, hops, grapefruit peel, irish moss, american ale yeast, and water.\r\nWhile not \"organic\" (a term still suspect in food and brewing), we think we do a good job of only putting only pure, natural ingredients in our beer, avoiding chemicals and extract flavorings.","created_on":"2009-04-14T01:49:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2019-03-18T06:16:12.000-04:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"id":507,"company_name":"Lighthouse Brewing Company Inc","tag":"Lighthouse-Brewing-Company-Inc","address":"#2 836 Devonshire Road","city":"Victoria","state":"British Columbia","postal":"V9A 4T4","country":"Canada","phone":"250-383-6500","fax":"250-383-0005","email":"info@lighthousebrewing.com","url":"http://www.lighthousebrewing.com/","checked_by":"Denyce","doubled_by":"Grey, Mack","notes":"Company email (February 2017)\r\n\"The brewers have told me that we use no animal products in our beer and we do all of our manufacturing on site.\"\r\n\r\nMack notes (February 2017)\r\n\"I spoke with an employee this morning in house and they now have a centrifuge (since october 2016) and no longer use the traditional fining agents.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2015):\r\n\"At the moment our beer is not vegan, as we use gelatin to clear all our beers in tank, including Numbskull and Shipwreck.

Their very name, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, would have one believe that God's original purpose was to have them ferment beer for us.  We have foisted upon them the Latin moniker as if by appending \"beer\" to their name somehow justifies their unpaid servitude in thousands of fermentation vessels around the world.  In reality, this is just the muticellular-chauvinist elite imposing their world view on the corporeally challenged who are unable to vocalize their ancient physio-chemical intercellular communication to our non-hearing ears.  \"Whats that?

I think that says more about us than them.

For those reasons, I would absolutely consider all of our beers (other than Honey Lager and Honey Wheat) vegan friendly!\"\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2008):\r\n\"You asked about animal products.  We don't use animal derived products in our beers, nor as lubricant in the process equipment for making beer or our packaging materials.\r\n\r\nFinings, such as Isinglass, Irish Moss or gelatin, are commonly added to fermented beers to aid in the settling of yeast and other suspended particles. We do not use finings in our beers. We eliminate the need for finings by thoroughly settling and removing trub before fermentation. Additionally, the beechwood we add to our lagering tanks attracts and holds back the yeast. After a lengthy 3 weeks of aging, most yeast has well settled onto the beechwood at the bottom of the tank and will stay there when the beer moves forward. These are some of the techniques we use so that our beers can be all-Natural without the use of additives, stabilizers, preservatives or finings.\r\n\r\nAlso, none of our beers contain egg or dairy.  The only one of our beers that is brewed with honey is our Michelob Honey Lager.  We use natural light amber wildflower honey harvested in the Northern Plains and the Great Lakes areas of the United States.\"\r\n","created_on":"2008-07-02T23:45:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2014-01-22T16:56:29.000-05:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"id":1436,"company_name":"Michigan Brewing Company:","tag":"Michigan-Brewing-Company","address":"1093 Highview Drive","city":"Webberville","state":"MI","postal":"48892","country":"USA","phone":"(517) 521-3600","fax":"","email":"bob@michiganbrewing.com","url":"www.michiganbrewing.com","checked_by":"Tanya","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"  Our beer products (Michigan Brewing Co., Celis and American Badass Beer brands) do not contain any animal ingredients nor are any animal products used in the processing or filtering of our products.\r\n\r\nWe are the sole manufacturer of the above brands.  \"","created_on":"2011-04-20T16:00:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2011-04-20T16:00:00.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":337,"company_name":"Mickey's","tag":"Mickeys","address":"","city":"Milwaukee","state":"WI","postal":"","country":"USA","phone":"","fax":"","email":"","url":"http://www.mickeys.com/","checked_by":"Kameron","doubled_by":"Douglass","notes":"Company email (September 2011):\r\n\r\n\"MillerCoors does not use any animal by-products in our brewing process, nor are there any animal sources used in our packaging.

We try to treat our yeast as humanely as possible - creating the most favorable conditions we can for good healthy reproduction during primary fermentation. However, once fermentation is complete, it's a different story. Cold temperatures are used to limit the activity of the yeast and encourage it to settle out in order to clear the products. Once clarity has been achieved, the product is racked off into another vessel and the yeast is discarded. Much of this yeast will still be alive, just in a subdued state. The unwanted yeast is introduced to an active composting system where it would die - probably with a couple of days. I'm not really sure if this is cruel or not - it's a very hard one to judge. In the natural scheme of things, fruit would fall on ripening and fermentation would occur spontaneously - followed by decomposition, so I guess it's not too far different.\"","created_on":"2011-04-05T10:31:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2011-09-29T10:55:43.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":6918,"company_name":"My'n'ers Cider","tag":"Myners-Cider","address":"Vaggs Lane","city":"Hordle","state":"","postal":"","country":"England","phone":"","fax":"","email":"mnecider@gmail.com","url":"https://www.facebook.com/MYNERSCIDER/","checked_by":"Sean","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (January 2019)\r\n\r\n\"Our cider is 100% apples, nothing more, nothing less.

We only use entire organic hops flowers instead of the frequently used, already pre-processed hops pellets or hops extracts. In the brewing, fermentation (done with our own, pure-bread-yeast) and storage process, we work entirely without any additives. The beer clarification is done via cold treatment (storage at very low temperatures) and a diatomaceous earth filter prior to bottling.\r\nThe only non-vegan component in our entire beer manufacturing process is the glue that we use for the labelling of our bottles. The labelling glue is made with casein, a substance that originates from pigs. We already investigated alternatives for this glue, but found no viable replacement glue. Water-based glues are not feasible because the bottling takes place in a wet environment and some of our products (e.g. non-alcoholic beverages) must be pasteurized.

Other\r\n    seasonal beers will come out in the future.\r\n  * We only use malt, hops, yeast and water\r\n  * The raw materials in all of our current line up are vegan friendly:\r\n    no honey or dairy products\r\n  * We do not use any animal based adhesives in our labelling and\r\n    packaging processes. Casein-based adhesives are usually used for\r\n    specific wet applications - everything we do on site is dry\r\n    application.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do everything on site here at 295 east 1st avenue, so no-third party\r\nprocesses are involved.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (April 2013):\r\n\"The answer is no. We use cryofine as a fining agent, which is a collagen derived from fish bladders. The reason we use this as we do not filter our beer and this is the most effective method for our situation.\r\nHowever, we are changing facilities and production methods with in a year and we will be filtering at that time. Whether or not we will continue to use animal based products I can't answer that now. But I\r\nwould encourage you to contact us again in the future and check. As a brewer my aim is have as many people enjoy our beer as possible,though I do need to balance that with the quality of the beer. If I do find a suitable alternative that works with our production methods I will make the switch. If you have any questions about beer and it's Vegan-ness, I\r\nwould get a hold of Tariq Kahn the brewer for Big Ridge Brewing in Surrey. He is Vegan and I believe produces a Vegan-friendly beer.\"","created_on":"2013-04-26T21:23:01.000-04:00","updated_on":"2015-06-30T21:01:03.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":2536,"company_name":"Redchurch Brewery","tag":"Redchurch-Brewery","address":"275-276 Poyser Street","city":"London","state":"","postal":"E2 9RF","country":"England","phone":"+44 (0)7968 173 097","fax":"","email":"enquiries@theredchurchbrewery.com","url":"http://theredchurchbrewery.com/index.php","checked_by":"Bones","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (October 2012):\r\n(27/10/12) \"See email below from the yeast manufacturer.

All our bottled beers do not use gelatin and these are for sale at our pub so even a vegan guest can at least drink a beer at our pub that is vegan.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email : feb 2010\r\n\"Actually they (the sour beers) are filtered as we have to filter out any fruit particulates, even the sour beers without fruit I filter as the process just seems to work better.\"\r\nEd note: Being filtered is vegan but fined is not.\r\n\r\nCompany Email: Dec 2010\r\n\"The sour / barrel beers regardless of bottle or keg do not use gelatin.  Also, any beer out for distribution from the brewery, such as beers on tap at Toronado do not have gelatin as they would have been made at the production brewery where we filter everything.  At our pub is just isn’t cost effective or labor effective to run a filter and honestly, the gelatin does a better job as it leaves more flavor behind.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\nUPDATE: KevinM\r\n\"that the draft offerings of Blind Pig, Damnation and Pliny the Elder that get served in Philly are also vegan.  (Not too many other areas outside of CA get kegs of Russian River)\r\nYay, this is so exciting (Pliny the Elder is considered by most to be the best example of that style - Imperial/Double IPA)\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE: JULY 2009 via KevinM\r\n\" Russian River started out as a small brewpub.  At the brewpub they use gelatin to fine all of the beers for clarification purposes.  This year, they started a production brewery to go along with the brewpub.  They were able to score a nice centrifuge (big machine that spins the beer around to get the yeast out) for this.  At that production facility they make Pliny the Elder (Double IPA), Blind Pig (IPA), and Damnation (Belgian Golden Strong Ale).  They bottle those beers and distribute them all over the country.  However, they also keg those beers (kegged =\u003e served on tap) and ship them to a few select markets outside of California.  (Philadelphia being one of them - yay for me!)   There's a good chance most other markets outside of California, Philly, and NYC don't even get draft Russian River stuff.\r\n\r\nSo....\r\n\r\nBlind Pig, Damnation, and Pliny the Elder on draught in bars, or in bottles = good\r\nAnything else (primarily only in bottles - these are barrel aged mostly sour beers) = bad\r\nAnything served in their brewpub in California = bad\r\n\r\nHere's the email I got from Vinnie on Friday:\r\nKevin,\r\nYes, the draft that makes it out to Philly is run through the centrifuge as\r\nwell.\r\nVinnie\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  JULY 2009 via Nicole\r\n\"The bottles of Blind Pig IPA Pliny the Elder, and Damnation do not employ gelatin in the production process.  They are ALWAYS made at our production brewery where we make beer in larger quantities and thus use a centrifuge to remove the yeast and not gelatin, we end up with the same results as we do at the pub where we use the gelatin.\" \r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2007\r\n\"Unfortunately, I use gelatin in all of our beers to fine them.

They had answer me and told me that voll damm and xibeca didn't contain any type of animal product, so are apt for vegan consumtion.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Kevin (June 2015):\r\n\"I have a vegan friend coming over later today and I wanted to offer him an Alhambra Especial 1925 (a nice blond spanish beer that i recommend you try if you like blond beers..) and I came upon the confusing entry for Estrella Damm (which is not a very good beer in my opinion). Maybe I can help. Your webpage for that beer reflects that your readers are very confused due to the fact that the manufacturer was written in spanish (which makes sense because it was from an online discussion in a spanish forum), but the manufacturer's statement is perfectly clear and direct. Estrella Damm is vegan.\r\n\r\nAccording to the response from the manufacturer, which appears first in castellano (what you would call \"spanish\", used in all parts of Spain) and lower on the page in catalán (the language of Catalunya, where Barcelona is located), Estrella Damm does not contain or utilize any animal ingredients or animal-derivative products in its manufacturing process. They state that in the very first sentence, but then they go on to elaborate to you, kind beer drinker, that fish-derivatives were once, at one time in beer history, used in some breweries in the world (mostly in ENGLAND), but that this is an outdated technology and has been abandoned probably or nearly completely. \r\n\r\nThey then state the beer may contain a single-celled fungus known as Saccharomyces, depending on whether it is filtered. What is that? Is it an animal, is it dangerous? No reason to be concerned, as they are merely referring to Brewer's Yeast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces), which comes as no surprise since it is BEER we are talking about.\r\n\r\nA different but equally important issue for all animal-loving beer drinkers (like me, I am not a vegan but I am an animal-rights person) is that some beer companies have participated in or promoted events that use animals as entertainment. In Spain, this would typically be circuses, zoos, bull-fighting, etc. The forum referenced on your webpage has a comment written in 2010 in which someone states that Estrella Damm did some kind of zoo-discount on the bottle at some point... (i guess it was kind of like how Coca-Cola has reduced admission prices to Six Flags if you bring the can to the amusement park...and of course Six Flags has had safari-zoo type of areas in their parks...)\r\n\r\nAnyway, hope that helps. There is no doubt that, according to the statement, Estrella Damm beers (all of them) are vegan.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (May 2015):\r\n\"Hiya! I noticed that the entry on your site for Estrella is rather confusing and perhaps lost in translation so I messaged them on their Facebook page and they replied that Estrella is indeed vegan.

Please use the information below to determine whether or not you are comfortable with purchasing this product. ****\r\n\r\nNote from Manu (October 2012):\r\n\"I just discovered your amazing website and, checking the beers of my country, I found that there's some controversy about Estrella Damm being vegan or not. Since that's the most common beer in Catalunya and I'm vegan (and beer lover), I'd like to try to shed some light on the topic.\r\n\r\nIn the spanish \"foro vegetariano\" there was some topic about it (http://www.forovegetariano.org/foro/archive/index.php/t-35611.html) where one of the users got a direct answer from the company:\r\n\r\n\"En Damm para la fabricación de nuestras cervezas no se utilizan componentes ni aditivos de origen animal.\r\nDerivados del pescado, en forma de gelatinas o colas, se habían utilizado históricamente sobre todo en algunas cervecerías inglesas como clarificantes de la cerveza antes de la filtración pero hoy en día esta práctica está bastante abandonada ya que las técnicas de filtración han mejorado muchísimo.\r\nLa cerveza se obtiene a partir de la fermentación de un mosto gracias a levaduras de la familia Saccharomyces (hongo unicelular) que pueden estar presentes en el producto final en función del tipo de cerveza del que se trate (filtrada o sin filtrar).\r\n\r\nReciba un cordial saludo\r\nCristina Rios.\r\nRble. Calidad Exterior\r\nGRUPO DAMM\"\r\n\r\nTranslation (by myself):\r\n\r\n\"In Damm we don't use components or additives from animal origin for the manufacturing of our beers.\r\nFish derivates, in form of jellies or colas, were used historically, specially in some English breweries, as a beer clarifier before the filtering but nowadays this practice is quite abandoned since filtering techniques have evolved a lot.\r\nThe beer is obtained from the fermentation of a wort by yeast from the Saccharomyces family (unicellular fungus) which can be present in the final product depending on the type of beer in question (filtered or unfiltered).\"\r\n\r\nSo... It seems in the end Estrella Damm is vegan friendly (at least that's something, since they are not worker friendly at all... But I guess that's another story).\"\r\n\r\nNote from Ryan (August 2012):\r\n\"Okay, this is a little complicated. I can see where Miguel is coming from as it does almost seem to suggest that it MIGHT contain fish products, as the phrasing is awkward. \r\n\r\nEssentially what it says is \r\n\r\nFish and fish-based products, except\r\n\r\na. Fish gelatine used to carry vitamins or preparations of carotenoids\r\n\r\nb. Fish gelatine used as clarifier in beer or wine\r\n\r\nNow ordinarily I'd agree that this was something to be concerned about, but looking at the date of that it was from 2009, and I believe the other message you have on the website, which directly contradicts this, is more recent. It's a tricky one.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Miguel (July 2012):\r\n\"You have been change again this beer to Vegan friendly. It is wrong. You can find attached a certificate in which is written the opposite, but it is a bit tricky to understand, also in Spanish.\" [Correction (August 2013): This is in Catalan, not Spanish]\r\n\r\nCompany email (June 2012): (email sent to Estrella Damm)\r\n\"A Grup Damm no es fan servir derivats del peix ni altres additius d'origen animal. \r\nEls derivats del peix en forma de gelatines o colas s'havien fet servir històricament a cerveseria com a clarificants de la cervesa abans de la filtració. Avui en dia, aquesta pràctica està molt abandonada degut a que les tècniques de filtració han millorat moltíssim.\"\r\n\r\n[Translation by MC]: \"At Damm Group, products derived from fish and other additives of animal origin are not used. Fish derivatives in the form of gelatins or glues were formerly used to clarify the beer before filtration. Today, this practice has been widely abandoned because filtration techniques have improved greatly.\"\r\n\r\nCorrection (April 2012):\r\n\"the company attached me this form and show that they use jelly fish. I know that it´s dificult to translate but you need to translate all the words in the 4 point. At the end of this line the use the word \"salvo\" that the meaning in english is \"except\". This part of the form is really convoluted, also in spanish.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2012):\r\nEditor's note: Company email was extensive, but does not mention the use of any animal products.","created_on":"2012-03-15T21:28:47.000-04:00","updated_on":"2017-05-07T10:08:57.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":1050,"company_name":"SA Brain \u0026 Co Ltd","tag":"SA-Brain-Co-Ltd","address":"The Cardiff Brewery","city":"Crawshay Street","state":"Cardiff","postal":"CF10 1SP","country":"Wales","phone":"+44 (0) 29 2040 2060","fax":"+44 (0) 29 2040 3344","email":"sab-enquiries@sabrain.com","url":"http://www.sabrain.com/","checked_by":"AngelA","doubled_by":"Andy, Ian, Michael, Simon, Bones, Paul, Kane","notes":"Company email (November 2017)\r\n\"Unfortunately, our coffee porter is brewed traditionally using isinglass, so would not be suitable for vegans.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (December 2016):\r\n\"At the moment our position is that like the vast majority of brewers, our beers are produced by traditional methods which includes the use of isinglass finings to clarify the beer.

Then our wines age in the tank and cold stabilize naturally through the winter and then we rack again in April. At that point red wines and some whites are racked into barrels for additional aging. The rest of the wines are bottled for sale. During the bottling process we use a .45 micron paper filter to polish the wine. That's it. Everything we sell is sold and manufactured at our winery. We have our own vineyards and contract with other local growers. We only use locally grown fruit from Dries Orchards and Kiwi Korners both 5 miles away in our fruit wines and hard cider. Kiwi Korners is actually certified organic. We pride ourselves in the products that we use.

Gutweed (Enteromorpha intestinalis) Hijiki or Hiziki (Sargassum fusiforme) Irish moss (Chondrus crispus) ... an seadible seaweed.\r\n\r\nFor filtration we use: Diatomaceous Earth, explained below:\r\nDiatomaceous earth (pronounced /?da?.?t??me???s ??r?/) also known as diatomite or kieselgur, is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that is easily crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder. It has a particle size ranging from less than 1 micron to more than 1 millimeter, but typically 10 to 200 microns.[1]  This powder has an abrasive feel, similar to pumice powder, and is very light, due to its high porosity. The typical chemical composition of oven dried diatomaceous earth is 80 to 90% silica, with 2 to 4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals) and 0.5 to 2% iron oxide.[1]\r\n\r\nDiatomaceous earth consists of fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae. It is used as a filtration aid, as a mild abrasive, as a mechanical insecticide, as an absorbent for liquids, as cat litter, as an activator in blood clotting studies, and as a component of dynamite. As it is also heat-resistant, it can be used as a thermal insulator.\r\n\r\nDiatoms[1]  are a major group of eukaryotic algae, and are one of the most common types of phytoplankton.\r\n\r\nPhytoplankton are the autotrophic  component of the plankton community. The name comes from the Greek words ????? (\"phyton\"), or \"plant\", and ???????? (\"planktos\"), meaning \"wanderer\" or \"drifter\".\r\n\r\nAnd finally, but not last, when we just want to clarify a beer without filtration we use a beer clarifying agent called Biofine Clear A3 also sold by Brewers Supply Group manufactured by Kerry. Biofine Clear A3 is a purified collodial solution of silicic acid (SiO2) in water. It has been specially formulated for the rapid sedimentation of yeast and other haze forming particles in beer.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email: March 2010\r\n\"Here at the Utah Brewers Co-op we use no products that are animal derived in any of our bottled or draft beers. That includes the Full line of Squatters and Wasatch beers.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: June 2007\r\n\"I can only speak for the beers i produce at my pub regarding their vegan status, because i do not know all the techniques of the other local brewers. My hefewiezen, pilsner, vienna and cask are the only vegan beers we have on tap all the time. I guess if i felt their was a larger demand for a variety of vegan beers i would make more of them. I use finnings to clarify my ales, and as you mentioned, this inhibits them from being vegan. If i do not clarify my beers, the yeast not only makes them cloudy and unpresentable, but it also creates an unpleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nWith that said, you will be happy to know that my assistant is also vegan and has showed great interest in find other ways to clarify our ales with something vegan friendly. I am definitely going to support him in his research efforts. FYI: any filtered beers are vegan. We use DE for filtration and this appears to me to vegan.","created_on":"2007-06-11T00:22:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2010-03-25T12:02:33.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":4952,"company_name":"Squawk Brewing Company","tag":"Squawk-Brewing-Company","address":"Tonge St","city":"Manchester","state":"","postal":"M12 6LY","country":"England","phone":"","fax":"","email":"https://www.facebook.com/SquawkBrewingCo/","url":"https://www.facebook.com/SquawkBrewingCo/","checked_by":"James","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (November 2016)\r\n\r\n\"...all our bottles and keg beers are vegan\"","created_on":"2016-11-11T09:15:07.000-05:00","updated_on":"2016-11-11T09:15:07.000-05:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"}},{"company":{"id":773,"company_name":"St Austell Brewery Company Limited","tag":"St-Austell-Brewery-Company-Limited","address":"63 Trevarthian Road,","city":"St. Austell","state":"Cornwall","postal":"PL25 4BY","country":"England","phone":"0845 2411122","fax":"","email":"roger.ryman@staustellbrewery.co.uk","url":"http://www.staustellbrewery.co.uk/","checked_by":"AngelA","doubled_by":"Ian, Kevin, Sarah, Tom, Mike, Sharon, Clare, Ali","notes":"Company email (April 2019)\r\n\" our CASK ales, in line with the vast majority of other cask ales produced in the UK, are clarified by the addition of isinglass finings to the beer in the cask.

The lactose warning is located near the barcode if anyone wants to check a specific beer. Honey is usually indicated on the front lower part of the beer’s label, as in “Ale brewed with honey.” The only beer you may encounter right now that is brewed with honey is the 20th Anniversary Citracado IPA.

Anytime we include ingredients beyond hops, barley, water and yeast, we’ll list it on our bottles.

We use perlite in our filtration, which is an amorphous volcanic glass.\r\n\r\nAlso, none of our beers are produced in any other part of world. As it stands, all of our beer is made here in Escondido, CA.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (August 2011):\r\n\"We are very proud of the fact that our beer is vegan and we are always happy to confirm with like-minded individuals such as yourself.

So there's no need to defect to a lesser beer.  The fining agent we use for our beer is a protein-binding agent derived from kelp.  No cow hooves, no fish guts, no bad karma points for you.  Now, occasionally, craft brewers such as ourselves may tinker around with small specialty batches and add various goodies like spices, fruit, and from time to time honey (although I don't recall that we've ever used it), but that would be explicitly stated.  Otherwise, our beers are made strictly with water, grain, hops, and yeast (a member of the fungus kingdom, mind you).  So here's to your health and that of our creaturely brethren (and sistren).

The only animal product which will find its way into any of our beers is piscine isinglass.\r\n\r\nAs far as cask beers go: While some brewers manage to avoid the use of isinglass by relying on a highly flocculent yeast or by sending beer out with rather low levels of residual yeast, we've found that neither of these approaches will give us beer that reliably conditions in cask and suits normal cellar operations.  Basically, we've found it pretty near impossible to sell pale, cask-conditioned beer unfined, so we do normally use isinglass in these products. On the other hand, our darker beers work well without finings, so we don't put any in, making them suitable for everyone, including vegetarians and vegans.\r\n\r\nThe cask beers of ours I'd suggest would be the \"No. 2 Stout\" or the \"Dark Country\".  And possibly other, occasional beers, which we'd identify on our website as being suitable for vegans.\r\n\r\n Regarding bottled beers: We're planning to start marketing a small range of bottle-conditioned beer and we hope that these will all be  unfined. At present our two filtered, carbonated beers are the \"IPA\" and the \"Dry Stout\".  Of these, the \"Dry Stout\" is unfined, hence suitable for vegans.\r\n \r\nAny utensils or containers that may have been in contact with isinglass will, as a matter of course, be cleaned thoroughly after such use, and before being used for anything else.\r\n\r\nWe're always looking to improve our products, and for me this would include moving away from the use of isinglass where we can.\"","created_on":"2011-06-01T06:49:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2012-03-25T09:40:40.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":4979,"company_name":"Strong Rope Brewery","tag":"Strong-Rope-Brewery","address":"574 A President Street","city":"Brooklyn","state":"New York","postal":"11215","country":"USA","phone":"(929) 337-8699","fax":"","email":"http://strongropebrewery.com/#contact-1-section","url":"http://strongropebrewery.com/","checked_by":"Gabriela","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (November 2016)\r\n\r\n\"Yes our beers are vegan.\"","created_on":"2016-11-30T09:05:46.000-05:00","updated_on":"2016-11-30T09:05:46.000-05:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":81,"company_name":"Strongbow - UK","tag":"Strongbow-UK","address":"","city":"","state":"","postal":"","country":"England","phone":"","fax":"","email":"consumercare@heineken.co.uk","url":"https://uk.strongbow.com/","checked_by":"Sarah","doubled_by":"Ross, Michael, Liam, Katharina, Bones, Anna, Sam, Craig, Ali","notes":"Company email (July 2018)\r\n\"Strongbow Original is not suitable for vegans/vegetarians as it contains cochineal.

The table below shows which of our Strongbow ciders are suitable for vegans, and which are not.  As you can see, Strongbow Dark Fruit is  not suitable for vegans, not because there are any animal-derived ingredients, but due to the method of manufacture of the juices/flavourings that are present in Dark Fruits.  You will also see that we do not claim that Strongbow Original is suitable for vegans.  This is because the method of making Strongbow Original means there is a relatively high likelihood that there could be some cochineal in it, albeit that we do not deliberately add it to the cider.  Regarding those ciders which we say are suitable for vegans, as I think we have previously advised, we can’t guarantee that very small amounts of ciders that are not vegan don’t get into ciders that are otherwise vegan.

It is used as a filtration aid in the chill filtration process when we make all of our whiskies. This is made into a paper that the whiskies will then be passed through.\r\n \r\nAs this material is made from fossilised algae it does affect the vegan whisky consumer. If a whisky is un-chill filtered then you will have no problems with our whiskies.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2013):\r\n\"'Our usual response re suitability for vegetarians, vegans and those with Celiac is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are aware of the condition known as Celiac disease where a person cannot tolerate a protein called gluten found in many cereals. Whilst the raw material for The Famous Grouse production will include barley, maize and wheat there is no gluten in the finished product as it is removed at the distillation stage. \r\nIf an allergy is oats specific then you can be assured that this cereal is not used in Scotch Whisky production.  However, our knowledge base is in whisky and not medicine so if in any doubt you should consult your doctor, pharmacist or dietician.\r\nThere are no animal products used in our whiskies so The Famous Grouse is suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. \r\n\r\nRegarding your specific enquiry, our Master Blender advises that fining in the sherry industry is carried out after the sherry is removed from the cask so no animal products come into contact with the casks.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Craig (March 2013):\r\n\"Famous Grouse has Highland Park as a principle ingredient and all Highland Park is from sherry casks, one of the very few distilleries to do so.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Grouse\r\nThe single malt whiskies used in The Famous Grouse blend include the Edrington owned Highland Park and The Macallan.\r\n\r\nHighland Park\r\nhttp://www.highlandpark.co.uk/lda/\r\n\r\nSHERRY OAK CASKS\r\nThe type of wood from which the cask is made is the most important element in encouraging specific flavours which give this single malt its own distinctive character. Spanish oak and American oak are both used to make casks for maturing Highland Park and each of these types of oak impart specific flavours to the spirit.\r\n\r\nMost of the Scotch whisky industry uses Bourbon barrels for maturation. At Highland Park Bourbon barrels are not routinely filled. Traditional oak casks are used; butts, puncheons or hogsheads – no barrels – seasoned with dry Oloroso sherry.\r\n\r\nThe oak source (American or Spanish) is of greater importance than the wine type. Spanish oak sherry casks give colour and dried fruit character whereas American oak sherry casks give vanilla and butterscotch flavours. Sherry casks are far more expensive but the view at Highland Park is that they are worth it for the character they give the maturing spirit. Typically, a sherry cask will cost 10 times as much as a Bourbon barrel.\r\n\r\nThe Edrington Group, proprietor of Highland Park, is the leading proponent of wood management within the Scotch whisky industry. It is estimated that up to 80% of the final flavours in bottled whisky can come from the wood. Sherry oak casks contribute to the distinctive richness and multi-dimensional complexity of Highland Park single malt Scotch whisky and are certainly a justifiable expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No sherry will be treated in this way [i.e. fined with animal ingredients] before it is filled into casks. This would be the same for all of our whiskies so we are all clear on the vegetarian front. We know this because we work with our forestry teams, coopers and sherry bodegas from start to finish and through these relationships we can monitor what is happening with every cask.\"\r\n\r\nChris says (July 2011):\r\n\"Just thought that I would let you know that Famous Grouse whisky is Vegan - They have a FAQ on their website which lists it:\r\nhttp://www.thefamousgrouse.com/Content/pdf/faqs.pdf","created_on":"2011-10-04T22:58:37.000-04:00","updated_on":"2017-06-02T05:34:03.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"}},{"company":{"id":2072,"company_name":"The Farmer's Cabinet","tag":"The-Farmers-Cabinet","address":"1113 Walnut St","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","postal":"","country":"USA","phone":"(215) 923-1113","fax":"","email":"http://www.thefarmerscabinet.com/contact/","url":"http://www.thefarmerscabinet.com/","checked_by":"Kevin M","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (December 2011):\r\n\"I don't use any finings at the Farmers' Cabinet so your in luck.\"\r\n\r\n(Note from Kevin: \"Victorian-styled bar/restaurant in Philly that has their own in-house brewery (it is actually technically off-site though).

Isinglass is composed of the swim bladders of a specific type of fish, which helps bond to other proteins and settles out during our conditioning phase. No noticeable flavor changes occur with the use of isinglass, and the actual amount that ends up in the bottle and keg is less than one part per billion. That's the best explanation I can give in defense of our use in relation to these four brews affecting a vegan or vegetarian diet. Honestly, ketchup probably contains a similar amount of unintentional insect parts as part of its finished product.\r\n\r\nOther clarifying agents that can be used involve either silica gels or plastic based media that are not digestible and not something we choose to use on this basis. If we ever move to filtration, isinglass we most likely become a thing of the past, but many arguments exist for unfiltered beer being the most flavorful and colorful traditionally crafted in the market.\r\n\r\nIt's a fun subject for me, and I've had several friendly arguments at festivals and bars when this question comes up.\r\n\r\nI'm always happy to relay that the Wheat, our biggest seller, is vegan.

So Hefe, Upheaval, and Deadlift are game!\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email (circa 2006)\r\n\"Some brewers use animal derived products in beer for the purposes of clarification.  Of interest is the collagen (protein) in such process aids.  The most common comes from certain fish, and is called isinglass.  For the same clarification purpose some brewers also use gelatin, which is less effective but easier to use than isinglass.  When using isinglass or gelatin, it is likely that only very small amounts of those compounds carryover into the finished beer.\r\nWidmer products do not contain isinglass or gelatin.  We receive quite a few questions on this topic and accordingly try to avoid using gelatin in any of our products, even the experimentals, but one exception is a beer that we produce in small volumes, called KGB Russian Stout, that on occasion contains gelatin.  Additionally, some beers that Widmer brews for charity under the Collaborator brand name contain gelatin.  The Collaborator products are not Widmer products, and are only available in the Portland, Oregon market, and in keg only. \r\nIn addition to the fining agents we have two brands that contain lactose, which is isolated and purified from whey. Depending on one's viewpoint a sugar, like lactose, that is isolated and purified from a dairy product, such as whey, may or may not be considered vegetarian or vegan.  If you are sensitive to this concept you should probably avoid Drop Top Amber and definitely avoid Snow Plow Milk Stout (aka Milk Stout).  DTA contains very little lactose, Snow Plow contains slightly less lactose than milk. One other possible exception is our use of milk sugar in Drop Top Amber ale.

This is a difficult question, as the interpretation can sometimes get blurred.  We are happy to tell you what is used in our beers and you can determine if our beers are vegan.  The reason for this is one of the main components of beer or any alcohol is yeast.  Yeast is a single cell organism that uses the sugars we create, by mixing water and malted barley, and converts the sugars to alcohol and carbon dioxide.  These single cell organisms do all the hard work for us, but unfortunately many of these cells die in the process and are discarded after use.  If you are ok with the use of yeast, all of our materials are friendly for vegans unless otherwise stated.  The reason I would say unless otherwise stated, is we do make a honey cream ale that states 'Honey Cream Ale.'  In addition to the four main components in beer; water, malted barley, hops, and yeast, we use the following: calcium sulfate, carrageenan, silicic acid, diatomaceous earth, fruits, herbs, spices, vegetables\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope this helps answer your questions about the beer produced by Wild Ride Brewing.

We think it is important for people to know about their food and drinks and how it is made.  Surprisingly enough, we are forbidden - by law- to put any kind of ingredient or nutritional label on our beers.  Breweries aren't governed by the FDA. The macro breweries lobbied the Federal Government very strongly in favor of not putting ingredient/nutritional labels on beer.  Crazy but true.
