Requires Selenium for Python.

Install it like this (Ubuntu/Debian):
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install -U selenium

Or for Mac
Install pip, instruction at http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html
sudo pip install -U selenium

Get updated wine.json from http://barnivore.com/api

Run python getwineproducers.py
and validate the resulting json list

Tips for validating the list:
The list will include false positives because of intentional fuzzy matching on manufacturers' names.
Regexp-search for company_name|manufacturer_name in the json file,
then double-check ones where these fields don't match.
Also check for when countries don't match exactly.
Then delete bad ones.

After that parse the json using generatehtml.py and produce a printable version
