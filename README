Finds vegan wines in Vinmonopolet's product list, using the Barnivore API (http://barnivore.com/old-api).
Employs fuzzy matching, as the manufacturer names in the databases don't always match, because of abbreviations and omissions of certain generic words
in the full company name.

Uses python 3.x.

Install it like this (Ubuntu/Debian):
sudo apt-get install python3

Or for Mac:
Install homebrew
then 
brew install python3

sudo -H pip3 install beautifulsoup4 --upgrade
sudo -H pip3 install requests --upgrade
sudo -H pip3 install fuzzywuzzy[speedup] --upgrade

Run python3 vegan_wine_search.py
and validate the resulting list in the json files

Tips for validating the list:
The list will include false positives because of the intentional fuzzy matching of manufacturers' names.
Regexp-search for Varenavn|manufacturer_name in the json file to highlight these fields.
Then for each company's wine list check if there is a name mismatch.
Also check for when countries don't match exactly (dev.country_mismatch = true entries)
Then delete bad ones.

After that, parse the json using generatehtml.py to produce a printable version
