Finds vegan wines on Vinmonopolet's website, using the Barnivore API (http://barnivore.com/api).
Employs fuzzy matching, as the manufacturer names in the databases don't always match, because of abbreviations and omissions of certain generic words
in the full company name.

Requires Selenium for Python.
Uses python 3.x.
Requires Chromedriver and Chrome installed, 
see https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/
Can easily be modified to use Firefox instead.

Install it like this (Ubuntu/Debian):
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo -H pip3 install -U selenium

Or for Mac:
Install homebrew
then 
brew install python3
sudo -H pip3 install -U selenium

Get updated wine.json from http://barnivore.com/api
It may have encoding errors, invalid utf-8 in it. 
Fix it with this command, iconv --verbose -f utf-8 -t utf-8//ignore wine.json > winenew.json && mv winenew.json wine.json

Run python3 getwineproducers.py
and validate the resulting json list

Tips for validating the list:
The list will include false positives because of intentional fuzzy matching of manufacturers' names.
Regexp-search for Produktnavn|manufacturer_name in the json file to highlight these fields.
Then for each company's wine list check if there is a name mismatch.
Also check for when countries don't match exactly.
Then delete bad ones.

After that, parse the json using generatehtml.py to produce a printable version
