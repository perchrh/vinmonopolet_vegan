Requires Selenium for Python.
Uses python 3.x.

Install it like this (Ubuntu/Debian):
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install -U selenium

Or for Mac:
Install homebrew
then 
brew install python3
sudo -H pip3 install selenium

Get updated wine.json from http://barnivore.com/api
It may have encoding errors, invalid utf-8 in it. 
Fix it with this command, iconv --verbose -f utf-8 -t utf-8//ignore wine.json > winenew.json && mv winenew.json wine.json

Run python3 getwineproducers.py
and validate the resulting json list

Tips for validating the list:
The list will include false positives because of intentional fuzzy matching of manufacturers' names.
Regexp-search for company_name|manufacturer_name in the json file to highlight these fields. 
Then for each company's wine list check if there is a name mismatch.
Also check for when countries don't match exactly.
Then delete bad ones.

After that, parse the json using generatehtml.py to produce a printable version
