Finds vegan wines in Vinmonopolet's product list, using the Barnivore API (http://barnivore.com/old-api).
Employs fuzzy matching, as the manufacturer names in the databases don't always match, because of abbreviations and omissions of certain generic words
in the full company name.

Uses python 3.x.

Install it like this (Ubuntu/Debian):
sudo apt-get install python3

Or for Mac:
Install homebrew
then 
brew install python3

Get updated wine.json from http://barnivore.com/wine.json
It may have encoding errors, invalid utf-8 in it. 
Fix it with this command, iconv --verbose -f utf-8 -t utf-8//ignore wine.json > winenew.json && mv winenew.json wine.json

Run python3 import.py
and validate the resulting list in the json file

Tips for validating the list:
The list will include false positives because of intentional fuzzy matching of manufacturers' names.
Regexp-search for Varenavn|manufacturer_name in the json file to highlight these fields.
Then for each company's wine list check if there is a name mismatch.
Also check for when countries don't match exactly (dev.country_mismatch = true entries)
Then delete bad ones.

After that, parse the json using generatehtml.py to produce a printable version
