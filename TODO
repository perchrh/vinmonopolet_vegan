Improve matching algorithm, especially when there are multiple matches and we want to find the best one. 
Maybe both lcs and match ratio, for both normalized name and original name must factor into a composite measure.


Report name errors to Vinmonopolet and to Barnivore by
actively searching for data duplicates:
compare every company name in each list to all other names in the same list, sort by similarity ratio,
report on top N similar names as potential duplicates.
There are known duplicates currently.
