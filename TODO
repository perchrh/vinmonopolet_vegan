Improve matching algorithm, especially when there are multiple matches and we want to find the best one. 
Maybe both lcs and match ratio, for both normalized name and original name must factor into a composite measure.

Companies with very short names can be attempted to normalize by removing a subset of stopwords.

Consider if these cases could be handled better:
Warning: ignoring match between companies 'Aalto Bodegas y Vi√±edos' and 'Bod. Aalto', listed names vary too much - 0.312, 1.000
Warning: ignoring match between companies 'Champagne Krug' and 'Krug', listed names vary too much - 0.444, 1.000
Warning: ignoring match between companies 'Rippon' and 'Rippon Vineyard & Winery', listed names vary too much - 0.400, 1.000
Warning: ignoring match between companies 'Vietti s.r.l.' and 'Vietti', listed names vary too much - 0.632, 0.857
