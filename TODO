Improve matching algorithm, especially when there are multiple matches and we want to find the best one. 
Maybe both lcs and match ratio, for both normalized name and original name must factor into a composite measure.
If the shortest word is length n, n>4, require a lcs of that length?

Companies with very short name can be attempted to normalize by removing a subset of stopwords.

Find more data errors by removing restrictions on Vinmonopolet assortment-groups.
